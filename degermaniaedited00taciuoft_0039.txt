THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BV TACJTUS 25

the work of the house among thern ¹, till the time comes when ·valour
chooses her own‚' and the solemn investiture with arms as it were
emancipates the youth from paternal rule and dedicates him to the
service of the State ². Henceforth war becomes the freeman’s chief
and proper work, but even in war the family and local bond still
asserts itself. Each ‘pagus' furnishes a company of the select foot
whose agility keeps paee with the mounted warrior-s in the van ³²,
while these horsemen themselves and the whole wedge-like phalanx
of the mass behind are grouped by families and clansmen standing
shoulder to shoulder 4; and even their women accompany the warriors
to the field, not only to tend and heaI, but to inspire the brave and
upbraid the yielding ⁵.

In connexion with their warfare stood another institution ¹³, noticed
by Tacitus as already in full force ⁷, and destined afterwards to affect
the framework not only of German but of European society, the
enrolment of young men in the ‘comitatus’ of a chief or ‘princeps’
The privilege of keeping such a body may be supposed to have
extended to all who bore this title 3, but in practice it must manifestly
have belonged to those only whose wealth and possessions gave thern
the means of supporting it, and most of all to the king or leader of
the state⁹, who certainly could alone give a public status to his
followers, while enrolment in its ranks, besides being sought for by
many as an honour, must have become the natural refuge of the
needy of all ranks and stations10. We have thus already the germ
of a state within a state, and the growth of a body of vassals wholly
dependent on their lord¹¹, living at his table, armed and enriched by

⁷ Caesar seems to know of an insti-
tution resembling it but temporary
rather than permanent ι*6. 2 3, 7—8). The
examples of Segestes and Inguiomerus
(see p. 22, note 4) attest its existence
in the time of Tiberius. Among Gauls
it is traceable at a considerably earlier
date (Polyb. 2. 17, 12).

⁸ ‘Princeps’ is generally singular in
e. 13-14‚ and is generally correlative
to ‘ comites,' but it seems best to take
it as explained by ‘principum aliquis’
in 0. 13, 1, and ‘ principes⁷ in 0. 12, 3.

¹¹ It has been thought that to be
a ‘comes’ involved even a sacrifice of
freedom, and it is probable that it did
involve some diminution of full civic
rights, which may be alludcd to in ‘nec
rubor' (e. 13, 2).
