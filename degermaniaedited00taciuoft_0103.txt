CAP. 26, 27. 85

ipsum non in totidem digerunt species : hiems et ver et aestas
intellectum ac vocabula habent, autumni perinde nomen ac
bona ignorantur.

27. Funerum nulla ambitio: id solum observatur. ut cor-
2pora clarorum virorum certis lignis crementur. struem rogi 5
nec vestibus nec odoribus cumulant: sua cuique arma, quo-
rundam igni et equus adicitur. sepulcrum caespes erigit:
monumentorum arduum et operosum honorem ut gravem
defunctis aspernantur. lamenta ac lacrimas cit0, dolorem et
tristitiam tarde ponunt. feminis lugere honestum est, viris 10

meminisse.

4. observant b and Haupt.

‘the corn crop is the only tribute exacted
from the soil?

annum quoque . . . n0n=‘ne an-
num quidem.' They do not even di-
vide the year into as many seasons as
we do. The old broad division of the
year, attested by Aryan languages gene-
rally, and still used by Thueyd„ is into
summer and winter, between which
spring and autumn are intermediate
stageS, and the Germans had no name
for the latter as a season. ‘ Herbst' is
probably of later date, and more pro-
perly ‘ harvest time,’ which with Romans
would fall in summer. It is to be noted
that we have the Latin ⁶ autumn ’ with
English names for the other seasons.

2. intellectum, ‘a meaning.‘

3. bona, such as the vintage, and
fruit gathering: cp. ‘pomifer auctum-
nus’ (Hor. Od. 4. 7, 11).

4. Funerum, &c. This forms the
fitting epilogue to this portion.

nulla ambitio, ⁶ there is no pomp' ;
111 contrast to Romans, whose 1111161315,
especially by the addition of gladia-
torial shows, had risen to enormous
eost. The Gauls had become extrava-
gant in this respect (Caes. 6. 19, 4), as
did later the Saxons and other Germans.

5. certis lignis, perhaps oak or
beech. Cremation 01501116 sort seems
implied to be, at this date, universal;
simple burial, as shown in the most
ancient graves, having perhaps become
obsolete or local. Cremation was abol-
ished by Christianity in the time of
Charles the Great (Ζ.).

struem, defined by genit. ‘rogi'

6. vestibus . . . odoribus. Such
are described as burnt in honour of
Germanicus (A. 3. 2, 2), and more than
a year's produce of the latter at that of
Poppaea (Plin. 12. 18, 41, 83). SS.
notes that this practice came in later
among the Germans.

7. equus, that the dead might ride
in state into ‘ walhallass The horse of
Alaric thus shared his funeral (Ζ.);
there is also evidence that favourite
hounds, and sometimes slaves, and even
wives (see on c. 19, 3) were sacrificed.
Similar customs prevailed (Caes. l. 1.)
at Gaulish funerals and among the early
Greeks (Hom. 11. 23‚171—175s>.

caespes erigit. This rhetorical ex-
pression (cp. H. 5. 6, 4) 5661115 taken
from Sen. (Ep. 8, 5), ‘hanc (domum)
utrum caespes erexerit an lapis . . .
nihil interest.’

8. monumentorum, such as those
at Rome, the mausoleum of AugustUS,
pyramid of Cestius, and other great
family tombs, the ‘magnae moles se-
pulchrorum' 01 Scn. de Brcv. Vit. 20, 5.

arduum . . . honorem, enallage sor
‘ arduorum, &c.

gravem. Cp. the frequent epitaph
‘ sit tibi terra levis?

9. lamenta et lacrimas: for the
alliteration cp. Introd. p. 10. Ss‘. notes
that in later times passionate grief is
sustained 101 three days, and the whole
mourning for seven or thirty days.

10. ponunt = ‘deponunt’: ep. ‘ ad
ponendum dolorem* (Cic. Tusc. 3. 28,

lugere . . . Tacitus

meminisse.
