THE ACCOUNT GJVEA' Bis TACJTFS 23

It is only in a few sentences that wc learn anything of the aggre-
gate of ‘ vici' forming the ‘pagus ¹,’ represented to us as also a judicial
centre, and as furnishing its hundred jurors to the court 2. and its
hundred picked warriors to the host³². lt is most commonly identi-
fied with the German ‘ Gau ' or English ‘ shire ⁴‚’ but. if so, apparently
with earlier and smaller divisions under such names than those which
are historically best known to us ⁵. There is much probability in the
view that the ‘pagus' was really the ‘hundred ·”,’ known to us later
as the chief centre' of judicial administration whether criminal or
civil under its presiding ‘ealdorman' and jurors ⁷. The ‘hundred‚’
as well as the village, was probably at first an aggregate of persons
or families rather than of territorial districts ἓ, and had lost its
numerical significance before we have authentic record of it ⁹.

We have no mention of any division at that time answering to the
province, or to the English shire as later understood¹⁰; the only
gathering above the ‘pagus' being the great ‘concilium’ of the
‘civitas,' the ‘allthing' or ‘folkmoot,’ at which all magistrates were
elected, the youth of the nation were solemnly invested with arms¹¹.
and great issues‚ such as those of war and peace, or grave criminal
charges involving the penalty of death, or whatever religious or other

mentioned together (c. 12 ‚5 : the ‘ cen-
teni comites’ would appear to belong
to the latter only, but probably the
former also had jurors. In the court
or ‘concilium' of the ‘vicus’ is seen
the origin of the manorial court, possi-
bly also of the parish vestry.

¹ The application of this term is
probably borrowed from Caesar, who
uses it both of Gauls and Germans.
with the former it seems to be a larger
subdivision than with the latter, as the
Gallie Helvetii had but four ‘ pagi'
(1. 12, 4), whereas Caesar‘s Suebi, who
answer in this respect to the Semnones
of Tacitus (c. 39, 4„ had one hundred.
·' Vici ’ and ‘ pagi' are coupled in c. 12, 3;
A. 1. 56, 53 and the latter are also men-
tioned in c. 6, 63 H. 415, 6, 26, 4.

2 c. 12, 3.

³ c. 6, 5. Caesar [4. 1. 4) says that
each ⁴ pagus ' of the Suebi sent one
thousand men to the host, whose places
were taken by a similar number in the
following year.

⁴ See Kemble, ch. iii.

⁵ The ‘Gaue' of Germany are given
in Spruner-Menke's Hand-Atlas, maps

31—36, and are larger divisions than
such as seem presupposed in c. 39, 4.
The word ‘shire' means originally a
division or share, and there is evidence
that the present hundreds in Cornwall
were once called shires, and names of
other smaller shires are traced in York-
shire, &c. (see Bp. Stubbs, pp. 111,
112, 1224. Smaller subdivisions would
tend to coalesce into larger as the
kingdoms or states became themselves
enlarged.

⁶ This view is taken by waitz

( Dentsche Verfassungs - Geschichte ),

whom Bp. Stubbs has followed.

⁷ c. 12. 3. On the ‘ hundreds' gene-
rally, see Kemble, ch. ix; Bp. Stubbs,
pp. 103, foll.

⁸ Bp. Stnbbs, pp. 33, 76.

⁹ lbid. p. 77. The English *hun-
dreds' are far smallcr subdivisions at
the time of Domesday than at present

ζ . 122).

ξ’ Bp. Stubbs‚pp. 125, foll. The · folk-
m00t‚’ as distinct from the witam {sce
above, p. 21, note 3„ becomes later
its ‘concilium' (ibid. p. 134*-
