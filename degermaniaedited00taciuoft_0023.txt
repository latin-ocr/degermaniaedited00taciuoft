LANGUAGE AND STVLE 11

et ira’ (c. 25, 2), ‘similitudine et inertia' (c. 28, 4), ‘oblectationi
oculisque' (c. 33, 2), ‘castra ac spatia’ (c. 37, 1), ‘formidine atquc
umbra’ (c. 43, 6), or by stilted expressions for common things, as
‘ingemere agris, inlaborare domibus, suas alienasque fortunas spe
metuque versare’ (c. 45, 6), or by somewhat daring personification
or metaphor. We have few, if any, bolder figures in his works than
‘donec aetas separet ingenuos, virtus adgnoscat’ (c. 20, 2), ‘Chattos
suos saltus Hercynius prosequitur simul atque deponit⁷ (c. 30, 1),
‘obstitit Oceanus in se inquiri’ (c. 34, 3 ¹).

If thus in some points the Germania approaches nearer to his earlier
manner, the traces of a study or imitation of other writers show more
resemblance to his later. The Ciceronian phraseology so prominent
in the ‘Dialogus ⁷ becomes supplanted by that taken from poets and
historians. His evident admiration of Vergil already bears fruit in
his description of the sacred grove (c. 39, 2), and in such expressions
as ‘originem gentis' (c. 2, 3), ‘bellatorem equum’ (c. 14, 4), ‘vocare
hostem' (c. 14, 5), ‘spina consertum’ (c. 17, 1), *nuptiis ambiuntur'
(c. 17, 4), ‘lac concretum’ (c. 23, 1), ‘expediam’ (c. 27, 3), ‘colles
rarescunt' (c. 30, 1), ‘velis ministrant' (c. 44, 2), ‘erigitur' (c. 46, 2)²;
Horace seems to leave a trace in the contrast of ‘mores and leges'
(c. 19. 5), and perhaps in ‘ferox bello' (c. 32, 4), Ovid in ‘pressos

. . curru' (c. 1-2, 4), perhaps in ‘nec rubor' (c. 13, 2), 311(1 ‘quan-
tum ad' (c. 21, 3) 3 Lucan perhaps in ‘ exsanguis senectus’ (c. 31, 5),
and the use of ‘annus' for ‘annona' (c. 14, 5). Among prose
authors, besides expressions borrowed from those from whom he is
known to have derived material 3, we trace Livy in ‘neque confirmare
neque refellere. in animo est' (c. 3, 4), ‘ saepta pudicitia' (c. 19, 1),
‘urgentibus imperii fatis’ (c. 33, 2), and should probably trace him
oftener if his excursus on the Germans had been preserved to us?
His debt to Sallust is apparently larger, and might well have seemed
larger still, had we more means of comparison. It has been stated
that it may extend to the general idea of such a separate work ⁵, and
to some of the material ⁶, and it shows itself further in the occasional
interspersion of sententious maxims7, also in such phrases as ‘dediti
