Danuvius molli et clementer edito montis Abnobae

iugo effusus pluris populos adit, donec in Ponticum mare sex
meatibus erumpat: septimum os paludibus hauritur.

2. Ipsos Germanos indigenas crediderim minimeque aliarum
gentium adventibus et hospitiis mixtOS, quia nec terra olim, 5
sed classibus advehebantur qui mutare sedes quaerebant,
et inmensus ultra utque sic dixerim adversus Oceanus raris

1. Arnobae and Arbonae B b C c, Abnobe H, Abnobae Rhenanus,

1. molli ; so ‘ molli. . ‚clivo' (Verg.
Ecl. 9, 7), and similar expressions in
Caesar.

elementer edito, cp. ‘colles cle-
menter adsurgentes (A. 13. 38, 5) ; so a
hill is said ‘ clementer accedi,' or ⁶ adiri '
(A. 12. 33, 2; H. 4. 52, 1); the sense
being derived from the use of the word
of gentle motion in winds or streams.
Here the expression (as also ‘ molli ') is
in contrast to ‘inaccesso ac praecipiti
vertice.’

Abnobae. This reading is con·
firmed by Pliny (4. 12, 24, 79), whom
Tacitus appears to follow, and by later
writers, also by an inscription ‘Deanae
(‘ Dianae ’) Abnobae ' found in the
locality (Orelli, 1986). The name is
taken to be the Romanized form of a
Celtic word, signifying a wood (or rock)
surrounded by water. The Danube
rises in Baden, on the eastern declivity
of the Black Forest.

2. pluris populos, following Pliny
(l.l.), ‘ per innumeras lapsus gentes.'

donee, often so used with pres.
subjunct. of simple facts in Tacitus (c.
35, 1; A. 2. 6, 5, δια), Pliny ma. &c.:
the use in c. 20, 2, &c. is different.

Ponticum mare, so in A. 13. 39, 1 :
cp. ‘os Ponticum' (A. 2. 54, 2). The
Euxine is called simply ⁶ Pontus’ in A.
12. 63, 2, &c.

3. meatibus, ‘ outlets 'z such an abl.
of direction, analogous to ‘ via‚' is com·
mon in Tacitus ; cp. ‘ finibus Frisiorum ⁷
(A. 1. 60, 2), ‘litore Oceani' (A. 1. 63,
5), &c.

erumpat, perhaps intended to con-
trast with the ‘ Oceano miscetur ‘ above.

septimum. Ovid speaks of the Ister
as ‘septemplex’ (Tr. 2. 2, 189), and
seven mouths are spoken of by Strabo
(7. 3, 15, 305) and others. Pliny (4.

12, 25, 79) gives six and names them.
At present, only three are generally
reekoned.

4. Ipsos, marking the transition from
the country to its people (the proper
subject): so ‘ipsi Britanni ' (Agr. 13, 1).

ίηᾱίςθῃαεεαύτόχθονας, born in the
country and its original inhabitants.
This is argued (15 from geography, on
two grounds (‘quia’ . . . ⁴ quis porro');
(2) from their traditions.

minimeque . . . . mixtos, a second
point, ‘ without any subsequent ad-
mixture of other blood ': cp. c. 4. 1.

5. adventibus et hospitiis, ⁶ by im-
migration and friendly intercourse.'

6. advehebantur, taken by zeugma
with ⁶ terra,’ strictly with ‘classibus'
‘ Advecti ' are contrasted with ‘ in-
digenae' in Agr. 11, 1, &c. On the
view taken by Tacitus of primitive
migrations, see Introd. p. 16.

quaerebant, so used with inf., analo-
gously to ‘ cupio,’ in Augustan poets and
Pliny ma. but not elsewhere in Tacitus.

7. inmensus ultra, ‘of immeasur-
able extent on the further side:’ ‘in-
mensus' has here its full meaning (see
c. 1, 1), and ‘ ultra’ would denote the
north and north-west both of Germany
and of the Roman world.

utque sie dixerim. This form of
expression, used by Tacitus here and in
A. 14. 53, 2 (where see note); Dial. 34,
2; 40, 3; perhaps also in Agr. 3, 3,
also by Quint. and Pliny mi., is a com·
bination of ‘ut sic dicam ’ and ‘ ut
dixerim‚⁷ both of which are modifications
in the silver age of the classical ‘ut ita
dicam? The expressions are all used
to qualify a statement which might
otherwise seem somewhat strong.

adversus, generally taken to mean
‘belonging to another world‚’ ‘antipo—
