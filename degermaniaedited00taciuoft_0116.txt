consensimus not necessarily ‘ nos
Romani,’ but general belief, as implied
in ‘ fama vulgavit!

2. Druso Germanico. The brother
of Tiberius is so spoken of in H. 5.
19, 2. The surname was not given till
after his death, and was borne by his
posterity. Suet. (Cl. 1) calls him the
first Roman who sailed the North Sea,
and the same language is used of his
expedition or that of Tiberius in ‘ M onu-
mentum Ancyranum,' v. 14 (see on c. 1,
IJ: ‘ classis mea per Oceanum ab ostio
Rheni ad solis orientis regiones usque
ad fines Cimbrorum ’navi-gavit, quo
neque terra neque mari quisquam Ro-
manus ante id tempus adit) It is some-
what strange that no other explorer is
here noticed, hence the suggested read-
ings ‘Druso, Germanico,' ‘ Druso et
Germanie0,’ ‘Druso, Neroni, Germa-
nico ' (cp. c. 37, 5).

obstitit, here alone with 366. and
inf„ analogous to the use of ‘prohi-
bere' in H. 1. 62, 4; A. Ι. 69, 1; 4.
37, 4. The Ocean is personified, as
above in ‘temptavimus,' &c., and con-
ceived to resent the inquiry as an in-
trusion.

3. mox, ‘afterwards'z cp. 6. 2, 5.

sanctiusque ac reverentius, ‘more
in accordance with piety and reverence.'
Perhaps he speaks ironically, as he
seems to regret the want of enterprise
(c. 41, 2).

4. actis, with reference to ‘adiit'
and ‘ magnificum.'

5. Hactenus, local, ‘ to this point' ε
cp. Mela 3. 1, 11 (‘hactenus ad occi-
dentem‚' &c.). Some stress seems laid
on ‘novimus’ (ί 50 sar to the west is

Germany well known’ s, as he here
passes to a less known region.

6. ingenti flexu, the‘ sinus’ of 6
37, 1, and c.1‚1. He appears to

„mean the great recess of Jussand, which

he perhaps took to 136 a general exten-
sion of Qe coast, rather than a penin-
sula, and'torbegin further westward.
recedit. This reading is confirmed
by the appearance of a reminiscence of
a sentence in Mela 3.1, S (‘ in illam
partein quae recessit ingens flexus ape-
ritur ³). On the other δ1131161 the MS.
text‘ redit' is supported by the‘ redit

Chaucorum. This people lived
along the coast from the Ems perhaps
to the Ε1136, and were divided into
‘ maiores ' and ‘ minores’ (A. 11. 19, 3),
parted by the XYeser. Their territory
would thus answer to part of Hano·
ver. Oldenburg, and Bremen. In part
at least they were subject to Rome
under Tiberius (A. 1. 38, Ι ; 60, 33 2.
17, 7), but afterwards revolted or were
let go, probably from A.D. 17. Cor-
bulo was prevented from attacking
them in A. 13. 47 (A.11.19,6), and they
are found in arms with Civilis (H. 4.
79, 33 ·1.9‚ 1). The account given of
them b> Tacitus 15 far more applicable
to them as a whole than that of Pliny, '
whose general description of them (16.

Ἰ, 1) 35 living on hillocks or platforms

surrounded at high tide, and gaining
a miserable subsistence by fishing,
could only be true of those on the ex-
treme coast. The name is thought to
be from a word signifying ‘ the high,'
probably in reference to stature (cp.
Vell. 2. 106, 1, cited below), or perhaps
to superiority (cp. ξ 4).
