4, succinum b.

tion is that of Urlichs, ‘hominum'
(ί human protection ³).

1. rarus ferri, &c. The mention
of these unarmed votaries seems to
suggest that of the arms of this people
in general. Iron is scarcer than even
among Germans generally (c. 6, Ι),
and they have commonly to use clubs
as weapons. Δ

frumenta . . . laborant = ‘in fru-
mentis colendis laborant.' K. compares
the concise expression ‘vallare noctem '
(c. 30, 2). ‘Laborare' is transitive in
Hor. Epod. 5, 603 the passive is used
in Plin. 23, pr. 2.

2. patientius, ‘more perseveringly)
On the German ‘inertia’ see c. 14, 53
15, 1 ; 26, 2.

3. sed et, i.e. not only do they
work the land, but also search the
seashore.

soli omnium, sc. ‘Germanorum'
Pytheas speaks of amber 4Plin. 37. 2, 1 1,
35) as found among the Gutones, and
sold by them to the Teutones. It is
really found in many other parts of
the world, but only on the shores of
the Baltic in sufficient quantity to be
an article of commerce.

4. sucinum, used sor amber in Plin.
ma., Mart., Juvr, and expressing its
character as an exudation (‘sucus').
Romans also boirow the Greek term
ἤλεκτρον, and (like the Greeks) use it
both of amber and of a metallic
compound of gold and silver. This
ambiguity affects the interpretation of
several passages, but it is probable
that amber is spoken of in the Odyssey
and Hesiod (see Merry on Od. 4. 73)
and in Hdt. 3. 115, and it carne to be
worked into the myth of the sisters of
Phaethon apparently as early as the
time of Aeschylus (Plin. 37. 2, 11, 31).

glesum all, text Mf.

Pliny gives an elaborate account of it
{⁴37. 2, 11, 30—51), bringing together
apparently all that was known down to
his own time, and showing the extreme
vagueness and ignorance of Greek
writers as to the locality whence it
came. He himself says that it reached
Rome chiefly through Pannonia, and
that the traders stated that it came
from a seashore 600 miles distant from
Carnuntum.

glaesum‚ so read by most recent
edd. after the best text (v. l. ‘glessum ‘)
of Pliny (l. 1. 42), who calls it a
German word, and adds that an island
‘Glaesaria,’ called by the barbarians
Austeravia, was known to Romans in
the time of Germanicus. The word
denotes brilliancy, from the same root
as ‘glare,’ ‘glassss &oz the modern
German ‘bernstein’ is connected with
‘brennen ' (⁴ to burn ’).

5. quae natura quaeve ratio. K.
supplies ‘ sit ’ with ‘ natura,' others take
the words as a hendiadys for ‘naturae
ratio,' ‘what natural process’ It is a
resinoid substance exuded from a t'ree
t‘pinites suciuifer') of the coal epocli or
produced during the formation oscoal or
lignite: see Humboldt‚ Kosmos, E. T.
gSabine) i. 273.

ut: cp. c. 2, 4: ‘barbaris,' dat. of
agent3 cp. c. 16, 13 31, 1; &c.

6. quin etiam, in anastrophe, as in
Verg. Aen. 2, 768, δερ.

7. eiectamenta, ‘ refuse';
and once in Appul.

nomen, ‘reputation' (cp. c. 13, 4).
Pliny (1.1. 35) cites Pytheas as speaking
of it as used and sold by the Germans
only as fuel. The great trade with Rome
was recent, as Pliny speaks of it (ξ 45δ
as ‘ percognitum nupe1·‚' and of a Roman
knight still living, who had been sent
