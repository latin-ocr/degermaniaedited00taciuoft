sordes omnium ae torpor : ora,
&c. Halm, Z.‚ Mr„ follow Heraus in
inserting ‘ ora,’ which might easily have
dropped out. Others retain the MSS.
text, but differ in respect of the stopping,
some putting a stop after ‘ torpor,'
others after ‘ procerum.’ The nomina-
tive by itself is harsh ; some such words
as ‘ propriae sunt ' having to be supplied
with ‘sordes'; and although it seems
clear that ‘ omnium ⁷ is opposed to
‘ procerum,’ it is not so certain whether
the ‘sordes ' and ‘ torpor' are meant to
be points of resemblance to Germans
(cp. 6. 20, 1 ; 15, Ι) or of difference (6.
22, 1; 14, 3). The latter view is most
in accordance with the context here as
a whole ; the whole passage ‘ sordes . . .
traxerunt’ being apparently a descrip-
tion of non-German traits, and German
⁴ proceres ' at least being generally
described as energetic (6. 13, 14). Some
follow Urlichs in inserting the words
·' sordes . . . proceruni' between ‘ dubito '
and ‘quamquam,’ making ‘omnium’
refer to all the three nations here men-
tioned.

2. habitum, ‘ appearance': cp. 6.
4, 2.

foedantur3 the Sarmatae being a
lower type.

moribus, sc. ‘ Sarmatarum,’ in eon-
trast to the mere ⁴ habitus,’ as also
‘ multum ' to ‘nonnihiL'

traxerunt, ‘ have derived ’ : cp. A.
15. 68, 4.

4. montium, the Οὐενεδικὰ ὅρη of
Ptol. 3. 5,1 5. Nothing worthy of the name
exists in this tract, but the Valda hills
near N ovgorod, and the higher ground
in which the rivers rise may be meant.

mixtos or mistos all, text all edd.
6. pecudum B b¹‚ peditum b‘2 e, text Lips.

5. fingunt c H M S,

erigitur, ‘lists itself⁷ : ep. ‘insula
. . . erigitur⁷ (Verg. Aen. S, 416).

pererrant, perhaps more emphatic
than ‘latrociniis'; for Germans also
had plundering habits (c. 14, 5), though
less pronounced than those of less
settled tribes.

tamen, ‘in spite of these differences.'

5. domos figunt, ‘they construet
permanent houses': cp. (Frisii) ‘ fixerant
domos' (A. 13. 54, 3).

6. pedum, taken also with ‘pernici-
tate.' The Sarmatae relied only on the
‘ pernicitas equorum,’ and were most in-
effieient on foot, most formidable on
horseback (H. 1. 79, 4).

7. Sarmatis, braehylogical for ‘ Sar-
matarum moribuss

Fennis mira feritas. The three
nations arc described in a descending
seties; the Bastarnae differed somewhat
from the German type, the Venedi
more, the Fenni most of all.

8. non arma. The bows and arrows
mentioned below are used to proeure
food and are not counted as arnis.

non penates, ‘no household' (cp.
c. 15, 1), no regular (lwelling place, in
contrast to ‘ domos figunt' above.

9. victui, Sec. : for these datives, cp.
e. 23, 1.

herba. This seems plainly incon-
sistent with what is said of their hunting.
He may mean only that they had no
agricultural produce, and had to live
to a great extent on wild plants and
roots.

cubile. Halm, after Wolfssin, reads
‘cubili,' to make the construction
answcr to that of ‘ victui'; but such
variations are common in Tacitus.
