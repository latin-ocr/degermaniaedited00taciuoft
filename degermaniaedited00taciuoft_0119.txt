of Pliny or even Mela. The latter (3.
3, 43 3. 6, 7) places the Cimbri (and

Teutons) on the ‘ sinus Codanus' beyond

the Elbe3 the former speaks distinctly
(2. 67, 167 ; 4. 13, 27, 96) of the
‘ Cimbrorum promunturium ’ (1116 Κιμ-
βρικὴ χερσόνησος of Ptol. 2. 11, 2).
Strabo, probably through a confused
account of their former habitation (see
note below), wrongly places thern in
his time on the coast between the Rhine
and Elbe (7. 2, 4, 2945. The Teutons,
formerly associated with them, and still
mentioned by Mela, Pliny, and Ptolemy,
may have been noticed by Tacitus else-
where (see on c. 40, 1). The Charydes
(see next note} are also placed here by
Ptol. (2. 11, 12).

Cimbri. After their 'great defeat in
B.C. 101, they are next mentioned in
the account of Roman exploration in the
time of Augustus in Mon. Anc. (see on
e. 34, 3), where it is added ‘ Cimbrique
et Charydes et Semnones et eiusdem
tractus alii Germanorum populi per
legatos amicitiam meam et populi
Romani petierunt' (see also Strab. 1.1.
2933 Vell. 2, 106, 1; Plin. 1.1.). The
tribes of the great invasion were for
a long time (see Introd. p. 17) looked
upon as Gauls, but are clearly distin-
guished as Germans by Caesar (1. 40, 5,
860), and the connexion of Cimbri and
Cymry is now taken to be an error.
They no doubt gathered Celtic peoples
to themselves in their wanderings, ancl
most of the information respecting them
came to Romans through Gallie mouths.
Hence the name ‘Cimbri’ appears to
be a Celtic (though taken in Plut. Mar.
1 1 tobe German) appellative (‘ robbers')‚
and the names of the kings (‘Teuto-
bocchus ' and ‘ Boiorix '), if really Ger-
man, have taken Gallie forms. The
whole subject is very fully treated in

6. acCc,etBb.

Mf. Deutsche Altertumskunde, ii: see
also Momms. Hist. E. T. 111. p. 178.
It is the opinion of Mf. that in the
narrative of the invasion Livy and Plu-
tarch used Posidonius, and that later
Latin writers rest on Livy.

1. parva nuno civitas. They fade
altogether out of subsequent history3
Ptol. probably follows only tradition
in mentioning them, and it is even
doubtful whether at this (late they had
any distinct existence.

gloria, best taken as abl. of respect :
cp.‘ (Vardanes) regreditur ingens gloria '
(A. 11. 10, 5).

2. utraque ripa. This cannot be
taken (with Rite] to mean one on the
Rhine and one on the Danube, or (with
Mf.) to mean the two coasts· of Jutland.
The two sides of the Rhine must be
meant, but nothing more is known of
the locality.

castra ae spatia, hendiadys sor
‘ castrorum spatia ’ or ‘ castra spatiosa.’

3. molem manusque, ‘the multi-
tude and the number of hands at work ';
so a camp is said ‘trium legionum
manus ostentare' (A. 1. 61, 3).

4. exitus, ‘emigration.' Caesar so
used ‘ exire finibus ’ (1. 5, 1), 01 ‘' exire '
(1. 33, 4), of nations leaving their horne.
Mf. makes the Cimbri to have then
dwelt on the middle Elbe, the Teutons
in north-west Germzmy.

fidem, ‘ the credibility' : cp. c.
39, 1.

sescentesimum 61, quadragesi-
mum. The consuls are those of .-x.t·.c.
641 (according to the Varronian era ‚
A.D. 1 13 ; when the Cimbri and Teutons
crossed the Rhine (Vell. 2. S, 3) and
made their way to Illyricum ‹,Liv. Epit.
63). Η61·6 and below Tacitus is in-
accmate, or uses round numbers.
