1 16 CORNELII TACJTI DE GERMANJA

in promisch sed clausa sub custode, et quidem servo, quia
subitos hostium incursus prohibet OceanuS‚ otiosae porro

neque ingenuum, ne libertinum quidem armis praeponere

probably exaggerated by the tales of
traders.

1. in promiscuo, ‘in every man's
nands'; so used of what is universal
(⁶ in* promiscuo licentiam ’) in Liv. 29.
17, 14. On the German habit in this
respect, cp. c. 13, 1, &c.

et quidem servo, parenthetical‚
not explained till ‘ enimvero,' δῖε.

quja, &c. The first cause shows
why they need not be armed at all
times, the second. why it is not thought
desirable that they should be.

2. porr03 cp. c. 2, 2 : ‘manus' pro-
bably ‘ hands‚’ personified.

3. enimvero, ‘and indeed‚' adding
a new and important point in the pre-
caution taken.

5. regia utilitas est, ‘it is a royal
policy ’ ; conciselyand somewhatharshly
used for ‘ regibus utilitati est' ; Madvig
would read ‘ subtilitas.' After this
sentence Schiitz (who is followed by Z.)
inserts the sentence from c. 45, 9

‘ Suionibus . . . degenerant ') ι see note
there.

6. aliud, i. e. different from the
Oceanus of c. 44, 2, which is itself the
‘exterior Oceanus' of c. 17, 2.

pigrum ac prope inmotum. A
similar description is given in Agr.
Ic, 6 of the sea between Britain and
Thule *gshetlandy These accounts rest
ultimately on Pytheas of Massilia (cir.
nc. 330), as cited in Strabo (2. 4, 1,
104, δῖα). This sea is likened to a
kind of molluscous substance (πλεύμων
θαλάττιος), ancl described elsewhere
(1. 4, 2, 63) as semi-solid (πεπηγυῖα),

8. ortus C c. 9. emergentis

the ‘ mare concretum ' of Pl. 4. 16, 30,
104; 37. 2. 11, 35, which is apparently
distinct from the ‘mare congelatum’
or ‘ mortuum‚’ called ‘ Morimarusa’ by
the Cimbri (id. 4. 14, 27, 94). Tacitus
appears here to identify them, and is
probably speaking frorn vague informa-
tion about the Arctic Ocean; but of
the account in the Agricola, and those
froin which it is derived, a more local
explanation has been sought in a belt
of calm and fog (see Z. here), which
may have been supposed to extend
further and otherwise exaggerated.

7. hinc fides, “it is believed on this
ground.’

quod extremus, &c., ·' that the twi-
light of sunset lasts to dawn ’ : the verb
⁴ eduro' is noted as extremely rare.
A similar account respecting north
Britain is given in Agr. 12, 3, and in
both passages Tacitus seems unaware
of the corresponding perpetual night
of winter, which is the more remarkable
in the face of the superior correctness
ofthe account given by Caesar (5. 13, 3),
also (from Hipparchus* by Strabo (2, 1,
18, 75⁸, and (from Pytheas and others)

by Pliny (2. 75, 775186). The passage

in the Agricola seems to show ignorance
of the spherical form of the earth.

9. hebetet, ‘dims'; so ‘dies hebe-
tarat sidera ' (Ov. M. 5, 444).

emergentis, ‘rising out of the ocean ³
zopp. to ‘ cadentis '). The various
corrections ‘ se mergentis‚’ ‘ immer—
gentis,' ‘ mergentis ’ seem mistaken.
Strabo (3. 1, 5, 138) cites from Posi-
donius, but disbelieves, a story of the
