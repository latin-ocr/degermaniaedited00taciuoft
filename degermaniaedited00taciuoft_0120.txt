jan became Cos. 11„ with Nerva, Cos
IV. on Jan. Ι, Α.Ι). 9S; and became
emperor on the death of the latter,
Jan. 25. The reckoning is important
as fixing the date of this book.

1. ducenti ferme, strictly 210 years.

colliguntur, ‘ are summed up’ ; so
‘ centum et viginti anni . . . colliguntur '
(Dial. 1¹7, 3).

tam diu Germania vincitur. The
last word is ironical, ‘so long takes
our (so-called& conquest of Germany,’
a phrase perhaps in the mouths of
the Roman war party (see Introd.
p. 6) : cp. ξ 6 (ί triumphati magis quam
vicfi’).

2. multa in vicem damna, sc.
‘ fuere' : ‘in vicem’ has the force of an
attributive adjective (‘ mutua ’): cp.
⁶ magnis in vicem usibus ’ (Agr. 24, 1),
‘ multae in vicem clades’ (H. 1. 65, 1J.

3. Samnis, &c. In such enumera-
tions Tacitus varies the wording, as
here by change from sing. to pl. and
from peoples to countries and back
again.

4. admonuere, ‘ have given as a
warning’ <by disaster) 3 cp. ‘ actos dolor
admonet annos ⁷ QTibull. 4. 1, 189).

regno Arsacis, ‘the Arsacid despot-
ism.' The kingdom and empire of the
Parthians was founded by Arsaces, cir.
B.C. 250, and the name was borne as
a title glike that of ‘ Caesar') by his
descendants till their fall before the
Sassanians in A.1). 226.

5. aerior, ‘more energetic': cp.
‘acri . . . . libertate ’ (A. 13. 50, 3>;
‘ vigor animi . . . . acrior’ (A. 3. 30, 5).

libertas. Even kingly governments
in Germany were not such ‘regna’ as
those in the East: cp. c. 7, 1, &o

6. Crassi. His destruction and that

of his army took place at Chartae in
Mesopotamia in B.C. 53.

amisso et ipse Pacoro, ‘ and that
too counterbalanced by the loss of
Pacorus’ ε ‘ipse ’ is used of ‘ Oriens ’ as
if the Parthian monarch had himself
been spoken of, and as if ‘amisso
Pacoro ’ had been an active past part.
in nominative, with an accus. (καὶ αὐτὸς
ἀπολέσας Πάκορον). Pacorus, son of the
Parthian king Orodes, was defeated and
slain by Ventidius in Syria, B.C. 38.

infra Ventidium deiectus, ‘cast
down beneath the feet of a Ventidius.’
The antecedents of their victor are con-
ceived as adding bitterness to their
ultimate defeat. P. Ventidius Bassus,
a Picenian, and in early life led in
triumph in the Social war, and said to
have been a muleteer, had been advanced
by Caesar and became consul in the
triumvirate, and gained a triumph in
Β. C. 38 for driving the Parthians out
of Syria and Asia Minor, which they
had occupied as conquerors for nearly
two years.

7. obiecerit, ‘ with what else could
the East taunt us.'

Carbone et Cassio. Cn. Papirius
Carbo was defeated by the Cimbri in
Illyricum in BC. 113 (Liv. Epit. 63).
Their next victory was that over M.
Junius Silanus, the consul of B.C. 109,
in Gaul (Liv. Epit. 65). This Tacitus,
apparently by error, omits, and substi-
tutes for it the defeat of L. Cassius
Longinus, the consul of B.C. 107, which
took place in Gaul, but was at the
hands of the Helvetian Tigurini <Lim
l.1.), who may have been in alliance

with the Cimbri, as were also the
AmbroneS.
