SOURCES OF INPORMATJON [3

subject ¹, though to what extent, or in what part of his work, or in
connexion with what events, it is not easy to say. It is more im-
portant to note that Livy, our historian’s other chief model, had
prefixed to his narrative of Caesar's war with Ariovistus an excursus
described in terms very similar to the title which Tacitus is thought to
have given to his own work ⁹.

His other sources ofinformation are unknown to us but may well have
been very numerous. Germans were often seen at Rome, and many
Romans had been brought in contact with many tribes as officials
in the provinces on the Rhine, or as traders in the interior. Even
the distant north-east had lately been opened up by the amber traffic
resulting from Roman luxury-‘³2 The results of all this observation
had probably occupied the minds of many antiquaries whose specu-
lations are traceable in several places throughout the work ⁴.

SECTION VI.

THE ACCOUNT GIVEN ΒΥ TACITUS AND ITS VALUE.

ln reviewing the subject-matter of this treatise, we have first to
consider the geographica] and ethnological portions, but chiefly the
account given of the‘ political‚ moral, and social condition of the
people.

Geography is never a strong point 'with Tacitus, and in this work
he seems to have thought it unnecessary to do more than speak in
very general terms. In tracing the boundaries he is led to speak
of the general course of the Rhine and Danube ⁵, without having to

¹ A fragment of his Histories [inc. 18
D; iii. 57 K; iii. 27 G) has ‘Germani
intectum corpus renonibus tegunt,'
where Dietsch makes the sentence con-
sistent by inserting ‘cetera' before ‘in-
tectum‚’ thinking the language of Tacitus
(e. 17, Ι) a reminiscence os it. Another
fragment explains ‘ renones' as ‘vestes
(le pellibus' (cp. Tac. c. 17, 2). Dietsch
cites several views as to the occasion
which might have led Sallust to give
some account os the Germans: some
even think that he may have described
them and other neighbouring races at
some length, and that his description
may be the source of Vergil's lines on
the people of the north (G. ῖς, 349-383Ὗ,

and those of Horace <see above, p. 7 y,
and of parts of Tacitus. It is on the
other hand possible that the fragment
represents only a passing remark sug-
gested by some resemblance or contrast
in other people.
