90 CORNELII TACITJ DE GERMANJA

Non numeraverim inter Germaniae popuIOS, quamquam4
trans Rhenum Danuviumque consederint, eos qui decumates
agros exercent: levissimus quisque Gallorum et inopia audax

dubiae possessionis

1. numeraverimus C.

warlike, the Mattiaci generally resemble
them, ‘except that they are yet more
vigorously inspirited by the very soil
and elimate of their land’ (a highland
tract, contrasted with the dead level of
the Batavian island). The order of the
words is rather against¹ taking ‘adhue'
with ‘suae,' ‘the land which is still
their own‚’ which they have not changed,
like the Batavians‚ for another.

1. numeraverim, the usual tense
where a writer speaks for himself: cp.
‘dixeri1n‚’ ⁴ crediderim‚' &c.

2. decumates. This adj. is ἄπ. εἷρ.
The analogy of ‘supernas,’ ‘infernas’
would make it a form of ‘ decumus,‘ but
that of‘ Campas ’ or ‘ Campans’ (Plaut.)
would allow us to take it as equivalent
to ‘decumanus’ Some would take it
(with Creuzer) as nominat. with ‘quis
but it appears to go better with ‘ agros '
(to which we should certainly expect
some defining adjective to be added),
and is probably an official designa-
tion, and is generally taken to mean
‘ subject to tithe,’ like ‘ ager decumanus'
in Cic. Verr. 2. 3, 6, 13. The district
is that of the upper Neckar and other
adjacent territory between the Rhine
and Danube, the subsequent Schwaben‚
now part of XYiirtemberg, and would
include the ‘ Helvetian desert ’ rsee on
c. 28, 2). The term seems evidently to
describe the tenure of the territory
before it became part of the province,
but we have no evidence of any kind to
explain it [see Mommsen, l.l. p. 152⁴).
It is known that elsewhere on -the
frontier extensive tracts, capable of
supporting large numbers of occupiers,
were left waste, nominally as pasture
for beasts to provision the troops. but
in far greater extent than was required
for that purpose “see A. 13. 54, 23 55,
3), and no doubt with the real object of
keeping the enemy at a distance. There
is perhaps something in the suggestion
that formal permission to settle on such
land, which rested with the emperor,
and in the case referred to above was

solum occupavere 3

absolutely refused, may here [where the
territory must have been much larger)
have been granted 3 the squatters having
to take their own risk of the ‘dubia
possessio ' and to pay tithes of produce,
possibly for the commissariat of the
soldierS. ’

3. exercent, ‘ cultivate ’ ;
31, 3, &c-

levissimus quisque, ‘ the most
worthless.' The land thus belongs ethno-
logieally to Gaul. though geographically
to Germany. For the change ‘to the
positive iu ‘ audax' cp. A. 1. 48, 3.

4. dubiae possessionis, from its
liability to invasion by the Germans.

limite aeto: cp. ‘limitem agit’
(Verg. Aen. 10, 514). The word ‘ limes,’
originally meaning the balk or path
separating the land of different persons,
is used of the road driven along the
frontier where the empire had no natural
boundaries (cp. A. Ι. 50, 23 2. 7, 4).
It could be crossed only at certain
points where forts (cp. ‘promotis prae-
sidiis') were erected, and tolls levied,
and was protected in the remaining
space by barricades. See Mommsen,
1.1. p. 122, note. The ‘limes’ here
spoken of is that shown on maps and
preserved in considerable portions,
which was the work of various emperors
and, when completed‚ probably among
the great defensive works of Hadrian
(vit. Hadr. 12, 6; Dio, 69. 9, Ι), ex-
tended from the Rhine near the Lahn
to the Danube near Regensburg ζ Ratis-
bon‘). For some general account of its
course and character, it may be sufficient
to refer to the notes here of SS. SS2.
and Ζ., also to Marquardt, Staatsv. i.
277, and especially to Mommsen, l.l.
pp. 154, foll. The portion of which
Tacitus speaks must be that which had
been laid out at a recent date by Domi-
tian, whom he purposely forbears to
mention. It is evident that that
emperor's war with the Chatti in A. D.
83 was not barren, as the historian
makes it (see e. 37, 6; Agr. 39, 35,

so in Agr.
