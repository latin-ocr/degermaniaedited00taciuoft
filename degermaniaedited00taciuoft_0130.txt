1. Retro, i.e. to the east and north-
east. The forest and mountain tract
which all these tribes are stated to
have occupied is that between Bohemia
and Silesia (the Riesengebirge), and the
watershed between the Oder and some
northern tributaries of the Danube, as
the VVaag and Gran.

Marsigni. The first part of the
name is that of the Marsi (see 6. 2, 4,
The termination (cp. Reu-
digni, 6. 40, Ι) may denote some kind
of eminence in that stock.

Cotini, so read by all recent edd„
with Dio, 71. 12, 33 the MSS. text
‘Gotini ' being apparently a confusion
of this Celtic tribe with the Goths (c.
44, Ι). Caesar mentions (6. 24, 2)
a Gallie tribe (Volcae Tectosages) on
the border of the Hercynian forest, but
there is no evidence connecting them
with this people.

Os13 on these cp. 6. 28, 3. Tacitus
here speaks of their language as Pan-
nonian, which shows them to be an
Illyrian race, specially related (see l. 1.)
to the Aravisci. The Illyrian lan·
guage, known only through the Alba-
nian (cp. c. 1, Ι), is considered to have
affinities to Greek and Iranian (see
Taylor, Origin of Aryans, p. 268).

Buri, mentioned again in the time
of Trajan and M. Aurelius (Dio, 68.
8, 1, 71. 18). Ptol. (2. 11, 20) calls
them a branch of the Lugians [see
below), and places them at the source
of the Vistula.

terga . . . claudunt, in a military

sense, regarding these peoples as con-
fronting the Roman empire.

3. cultu, ‘ mode of life,’ as in
c. 46, 1.

Suebos. More properly they seem
to belong to the Vandilii of 6. 2, 4.

referunt: cp. c. 20, 3.

4. et quod . . . patiuntur, ‘ and the
fact that they submit to,’ co-ordinated
with ‘lingua' as the subject of ‘arguit.'

5. partem3 i.e. the one (probably
the Osi> were tributary to the Sarmatae
(the Iazyges noted on c. 1, Ι), the other,
probably the Cotini, to the Quadi.

6. quo magis pudeat, i.e. because
they have the material ready to hand
which should make arms to win their
freedom, and which was scarce in Ger-
many (6. 6, Ι). Iron mines in the part
of the Hercynian mountaius near the
Quadi (1.6. near Crakow) were known
to Ptol. (2. 11, 26).

7. ceterum, ‘but especially': cp.
A. 12. 59, 2.

8. montium iugumque: some omit
or bracket the latter word, others both,
as a repetition from the line below, or
as glosses. If both are retained, ‘iu-
gum’ may be explained by the follow-
ing ‘ continuum iugum' (on which see
on ξ 1), as the ridge, distinguished from
certain summits.

9. ultra quod. Thelocality ofthese
tribes would be in Silesia and Poland,
between the Oder and Vistula.

10. agunt: cp. c. 29, 3.

Lugiorum: this reading is defended
from Strab. and Ptol. (Λοίνγιοι). Dio
