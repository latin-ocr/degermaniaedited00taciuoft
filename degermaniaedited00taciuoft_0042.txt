The relation os this military organization at this date to that of the
freemen grouped by families and clans⁶ is in no way indicated by

that the ‘comitatus' was designed to open a military career to those
who from youth, poverty‚ or other cause, were unable to fight at their
own cost in the tribal phalanx. But it is easy to see that it was
destined to encroach upon and displace the popular gaffiering, to
supersede the patriotic by the personal bond of allegiance, and to
