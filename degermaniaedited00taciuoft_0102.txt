on an equal footing. Also in the mark
system it appears that the original dis-
tribution of the arable area was into
exactly equal portions to each free
family (Maine, p. 81), but that such
*equality became set aside in course of
time.

partiuntur. The meaning of this
and of ‘ occupantur' above are by no
means clear. If we suppose anything
approaching to the mark system to
be spoken of, we should explain the
partition here spoken of to refer to
the arable 'land only, and to be an
allotment, with the proprietorship still
retained by the community. But the
passage as it stands contains no such
limitations, and it is open to take it to
mean that the whole ‘ ager’ was par-
titioned among families or individuals‚
and as private property3 in which case
‘ occupantur ' would only mean that the
undivided territory was taken possession
of by the whole community or elan in-
tended to constitute the village (566 note
on c. ’7, 3) at the first conquest or settle-
ment, and that its proprietorship was
done away with by the partition. It
(loes not seem clear whether (as Asbach
thinks] any resemblance or contrast to
the Roman ‘ager publicus ' is implied.

facilitatem, &c., i. e. the extent of
territory makes it easy to carry out this
distribution and give every one enough.
Mf. less well stops these words to go
with those which follow.

1. arva per annos mutant. Caesar
says of the Suebi (4. 1, 7) and of the
Germans generally (6. 22, 2), that they
were compelled every year to shift their
dwelling altogether, and go on to an-
other spot, thus making their life much
what Horace represents as that of the
nomad Scythians and Getae (566 Introd.
p. 7'. This may have been at that
time true at least of certain tribes, as of
those called Suebi (see on c. 38, Ι), but
Tacitus, if he meant to follow Caesar,
would be inconsistent with himself, as

he certainly speaks of fixed dwellings
(c. 16, διαὶ, and pointedly distinguishes
even the least advanced Germans from
nomads (c. 46, 2). He only speaks
here, however, of a yearly change of
cultivated land <‘ arva ²). This might
be explained as an inaccurate account
of the system of fallowing enforced on
the allottees (see note on ᾧ 1), or of
periodical redistribution of assignments,
or shifting of the whole arable mark
from one part of the village domain to
another (see Maine, 1.l.). The words
would seem, however, to be better taken
as representing an earlier and ruder
system under which each householder
ploughs a fresh piece out of the pasture
eachyear, letting the previously ploughed
land go back to waste or grass. This
might equally be the mode of culture
whether the ‘ager' out of which the
plough land was taken was the property
of the individual or of the community3
and if the domain was large (566 next
note), it might be some years before the
same piece was ploughed again. Mr. See-
bohm (p. 344) speaks of such a system
as attested by lVelsh laws, and termed
‘ coaration of the waste.' The Germans
had at this time no rotation of crops
(‘ sola terrae seges imperatur ').

ot superest ager, ‘and the domain
(distinct from ‘arva’s is abundant '
(cp. c. 6, 1) ; there is always spare land
that has not been ploughed, so that this
system is easily kept up. The sentence
is parenthetical, as the following ‘ enim'
refers to ‘ arva . . . mutant,' explaining
that their mode of husbandry is not such
'as to make it necessary that the same
land should be kept under cultivation.

2. neo enim, &c., ‘for they do not
try to vie with the fertility of the soil
(increase its fertility) by toil, so as to
plant orchards, and irrigate gardens (as
Romans did: cp. Hor. Sat. 2. 4, 16),
and separate meadows srom rough pas-
ture.'
