10. oxiones 13¹, oxionas bl c, exionas C, etionas B2 b2 and two others.

1. opes, so HalmandZ., afterMeiser
(cp. c. 5, 2); perhaps more likely to
have been written than‘ spes, 'as giving
a contrast to‘ paupertas. Other edd.
retain the MSS. text. W ith the Germans
archery seems to have been a late intro-
duction‚ as ( Pseil' (arrow) is thought to
be a loan—word from ‘pilum ³ [Taylor‚
Origin of Aryans, p 151).

inopia ferri: cp. c. 45, 3.

asperam, properly ‘’sharpen' (cp.
pugionem. . .·35Ρ61311 iussit, A. 15.

airow-heads were used in the tirne of
Pausanias (Att. 21, 5) by Sarmatians,
and are stated to be even now in use
in Lapland and in parts of Siberia.

2. comitantur, sc. ‘feminae viros.7
The extreme form of the hunter’s life
is that in which women hunt as well as
men.

3. petunt, ‘claim for themselves?

4. suffugium: for the genit. cp. c.
16, 4.

aliquo ramorum nexu. Laplanders
are described as living still in hovels,
made of four bougbs bent together and
held in place by twisted twigs and
covered with some sort of canvas, · and

such a mode of life 1s described by Hdt.
4. 23, 6), but with some distinction
between summer ancl winter (111 ellings,
which Tacitus here' lgnorcs.

5. redeunt, ie. from hunting.

receptaculum, their 1efuge’ when
11161 6311 hunt no inore.

beatiusarbitrantur, &o The ascrip-
tion of a philosophical xiew of life to

such people is to be noted as a fiourish
of rhetoric.

6. ingemere agris (dat.); imitated
from ‘bi(lenti‚' ‘aratro ingemere ' (Lucr.
5, 209; Verg. G. 1, 45).

inlaborare domibus. This verb is
ἅπ. εἷρ. and evidently coined to answer
to ‘ingemere' It would seem there-
fore that it must take the 531116 con-
struction, and that the phrase must
mean ‘toil over house builtling‚' in
contrast to their rude shelter above
described. K. takes it to mean ‘ labour
indoors,’ thinking that Tacitus means
to describe the three leading forms
of civilized industrial life, that of
the agriculturist, the artisan, and the
trader.

7. versare, ⁴ to traffic with their own
and others' fortunes under hope and
sear ' ; as do all traders.

securi, &c.. ‘ having nothing to sear
at the hands of men or godsss i. e. hav lng
nothing to excite the‘ invidia’ of either,
nothing (except life) of which they
could be depriy ed.

9. ne voto quidem opus esset, they
have nothing to pray for 01· long for;
have neither a longing nor even the idea
of one.

cetera iam fabulosa, ‘all from this
point is fabulous.’

10. Hellusios, nowhere else men-
tioned, and taken by Mf. to mean
⁶ giants ⁷ A people of somewhat simi-
lar name (⁶ Η11161101165’ ) are placed by
Pliny (4. 14, 27 ,)96 111 Scandinavia.
