veste, ‘ covering,’ varied below to
‘ vestes.'

1. sacerdoti : apparently a male
priest is meant. Conversely, the cha-
riot of Freyr appears to have been
driven by a virgin priestess. It is plain
from ξ 5, that the slaves also touched
the chariot during the ceremonies.

penetrali. Some take this of the
chariot, others of the innermost reeess
of the forest, as also ‘templo ' below;
but perhaps the latter word, as also the
mention of ‘ Tamfanae templum ' (A. Ι.
5 1, 2), shows that the statement in c. 9, 3
requires some qualification.

2. bubus feminis, the usual expres·
sion for cows in sacred formulae. The
use of cows or oxen instead of horses
(c. 10, 4) on such occasions is a relic of
great antiquity (ep. Hdt. Ι. 31, 3; Verg.
G. 3, 532), noted as surviving in the
state processions of the Merovingian
kings.

3. adventu hospitioque, ‘by arriv-
ing at them and becoming their guest ' :
cp. c. 2, 1.

5. nota; some read ‘inmota' (A. 4.
32, 33 15. 27, 3; 46, 2), which makes
‘ amata ' more emphatic. Heraus omits
the second ‘tantu1n,' and thus weakens
the rhetorical force. Lachmann and
Haupt reverse the order, reading ‘amata '
. . . ‘ nota.’

6. conversatione, ‘intercourse ’z cp.
‘intervenire rebus hominum.‘

1 1. uerborum MSS„ suenorum ΗΞ, text Rhen.

8. numen ipsum, i. e. something
alleged to be the deity itself; probably
not an image, but some symbol or fetish.
Tacitus would imply that this supersti-
tion sank below the general belief (cp.
c. 9, 3).

secreto lacu ‘ in a secluded lake:

abluitur, as if to purify her from
human contact. The ablution of statues
had place in Roman ritual: cp. A. 15,
44, 1, and note.

9. quos . . lacus haurit. This
may not only have been to ensure se-
crecy (see Iornandes on the burial of
Alaric, cited in Orelli), but part of the
ceremony itself.

arcanus, &c., ‘hence a mysterious
sear and pious ignorance.’ The noun
‘ignorantia’ takes the construction os
a verb.

10. illud; i. e. the interior os the
charior, and the symbol.

1 1. Et, haee, διο. He passes to those
Suebic tribes which were better known
to the Romans.

secretiora Germaniae. This sul>-
stantival use of a neuter adject. with
genit. is rare before Livy. with Taci-
tus it has not always a partitive soree.

12. quo modo . . . sie, sor ‘ut . ..
sic ’; osten so used by Tacitus, also by
Cic.: here ‘ut‚' in another sense, has
immediately preceded.

Rhenum. He had traced back from
