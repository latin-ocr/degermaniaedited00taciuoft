common in poets, but very rare in
prose : cp. ‘coniectare erat' (A. 16. 34,
25, ‘negare sit' (Liv. 42. 41, 2), cited
by Nipperdey as the only other in-
stances.

1. legatis et principibus, ‘ to their
envoys abroad and rulers at home.’
The latter term (see notes on c. 10, 53
11, Ι) is here probably taken in a wide
sense. It is used of German chiefs by
Caesar, once as in e. 12, 3 (see note
there), elsewhere (4. 11, 33 13, 4; 6.
22, 2) perhaps less definitely.

2. non in alia vilitate, ‘no less
slightly valued' (cp. ‘neque alia . . .
pietate,' A. 3. 16, 5), i. e. in common
daily use ; a concise expression for ‘ non
in alio pretio quam ea quae vilia sunt’
(some inferior MSS. have ‘utilitate ').
The silves-mounted drinking horns de-
scribed by Caesar (6. 28, 6) seem chiefly
valued as trophies of the chase.

quamquam, qualifying the previous
statements.

3. proximi, ‘those nearest to uS,’
on the Rhine and Danube frontier.

usum commerciorum, ‘the require-
ments (cp. A. 4. 5, 6, &c.) of trade)
On Roman trades in Germany see A. 2.
62, 4, &c The Germans exported slaves
(c. 24, 4{ , amber (c. 45, 4), hides (A. 4.
72, 2), &c

in pretio habent, an unusual ex-
pression sor ‘ magni habent’ (Pram.)

4. adgnoscunt, ‘ recognize as of
value.’

5. simplicius, ‘ more naturally.'

7. serratos bigatosque (sc. ‘de-

narios']‚ ‘with milled edges and

the Republic‚ and were heavier than
the Neronian coinage: see D. of Ant. i.

quoque, i. e. besides preferring old
silver to new, they prefer silver generally
to gold. It has been noted that Roman
silver coins are common in Germany,
and gold (until the third century) very
rare.

8. nulla adfectione, causal
varied to ‘ quia,' &c

9. promiscua, things in general use
(cp. c. 44, 4), not costly luxuries for
the few.

10. Ne ferrum, &c. The mention of
metals leads him to speak of weapons,
and thus introduces the section on
manners and customs lasting down to
c. 27.

superest, ‘is abundant’; so in c. 26, ,
2; Agr. 44, 2; 45, 6, &oz that some
iron was found is seen from c. 43, 2.

general? He does not note weapons
of other metal as in use at that time3
and the bone arrowheads of the Fenni

their low condition. It is thought that
iron became known to the Slaves and
Germans in the sixth or fifth century
Bc, and the name ‘Eisen ’ is taken to be
from that of bronze (‘aes,’ &cm See
Taylor, Origin of the Aryans, ch. 3.

11. rari, some few: cp. ‘ raris . . .
