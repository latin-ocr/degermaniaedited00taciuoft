LIFE OF TACJTUS 3

SECTION ΙΙ.
LIFE OF TACtTus To THE DATE or< THE GERMANIA.

The reckoning of time in c. 37, 2 would show the work to have
been completed in A. D. 98, the first year of Trajan's principate ¹.

Tacitus was born, apparently of an equestrian family, probably not
earlier than A. D. 50 nor later than A. D. 55 2. He was brought up to
the forensic profession, was admitted in youth to the society of the
great orators and men of letters of the time 3, and was probably
a pupil of Quintilian. In A. D. 77 or 78 he was married to the
daughter of Cn. Julius Agricola ⁴², and at about the same date he
began his public career, receiving successive steps of promotion by
the direct favour of Vespasian‚ Titus, and Domitian ⁵, under the latter
of whom he had become praetor and ‘ quindecimvir sacris faciendis ³
in A. D. 88 ⁶. Up to this date his life had been spent in Rome, where
we find from his friend the younger Pliny⁷ that he had reached an
extremely high position among the orators of the day and was one
of the leaders of the Roman bar. Soon after his praetorship he left
Rome for four years8 (A. D. 89-93‚ or 90—94), and was thus absent
at the death of his father-in-law Agricola. His absence must have
been due to the tenure of some provincial appointment, such as
a senator of praetorian rank could hold. It has been thought that
he may have been governor (legatus Augusti propraetore) of Gallia
Belgica ⁹, and may thus have acquired some personal knowledge of
the nearer Germans 1⁰. On his return to Rome he lived in evil times,
and must have been so far unacceptable to Domitian that he received
no further favour, though he appears to have avoided imperilling
himself by active opposition¹³. To Nerva he was indebted for tho

¹ The fact that Trajan alone is men-
tioned as consul would show that Nerva
was then dead, but it does not seem
necessary to assume, with Asbach‚ that
the publication must have taken place
while Trajan was still actually consul ;
i.e. within the two first months of the
year.

⁰ He could possibly have been a
legatus legionis in one of the ‘Ger-
maniae‚’ but this is not a kind of employ-
ment that he is at all likely to havc
held.

¹⁰ It is very doubtful see below, p. 12)
whether he ever had such personal know-
