distinct from that spoken of in c. 30, 1,
and is perhaps the mountain tract be-
tween Bavaria and Bohemia (Bohmer-
wald). Mommsen (Hist. iii. E. T.
p. 174) thinks it here probably the
Rauhe Alp, between the Neckar and
Danube. The name is thought to be
Celtic ζ = ‘ height ’).

Moenum, the Main; also taken to
be a Celtic name (‘flowing'). The
district meant is taken by Mommsen
(1.1.) to include the modern Swabia and
Franconia, or parts of Bavaria, XViir‘tem-
berg, and Baden. The Helvetii must
have been driven out before the time of
Caesar, who knows of them only in
Switzerland, and part of the district
became the ‘ agri decumates ’ of c. 29,
4, but the name Ἐλουητίων ἕρημος sur-
vived in this region when Ptolemy
‘wrote (2. 11, 10).

Marcomani [c. 42, 1, and note). This

(Mommsen, 1. l.) is known in Italy (Liv.
5. 35, 2), Noricum (Caes. 1. 5, 3), and
elsewhere, also in Gaul itself as asso-
ciated with the Aedui (Id. 1. 28, 5).

2. Boihaemi (see various readings),
the name given by Velleius (2. 109, 3)
to the tract occupied by Maroboduus
(see c. 42, 2), by Strabo (7, 1, 3, 290)
to his headquarters (Βασίλειον). The
last part ofthe name is German (‘ Haim’
or ‘ Heim ' ι ‘ home ’).

15, 3, an Illyrian people of Pannonia,
near the Platten See, in Hungary. The
name is thought by Zeuss to be Celtic,
meaning‘ dwellers on the Arabo ’ (Raab).

4. Osis: in c. 43, 1, it is distinetly
stated that th'eir Pannonian language
showed them not to be Germans. It
is implied here that they had otherwise
closer affinity to the Aravisci than to
the Pannonians generally, but it could
hardly have been doubtful to the his-
torian which nation was the offshoot of
the other, and it seems impossible to
bring the two passages into harmony.
The difficulty is inereased by ‘ Germano·
rum natione,' which is most probably
no more than the gloss of some per-
plexed critic 3 though many have retained
it, taken in a loose sense (ί reckoned as
Germans’), as part of the supposition
here treated as uncertain.

no more motive for migration one way
than the other.

7. Treveri, &c. Here the mention of
Germans in Gaul begins; the doubtful
cases being put first. The Treveri lived
in the district of their town, colonized
as ‘Augusta Treverorum' (Trier or
Tra-es), and appear to have been Gauls
assimilated to Germans through their
neighbourhood [Β. G. 8. 25, 2). They
are stated to have called in Roman
aid against German oppressors (H. 4.
