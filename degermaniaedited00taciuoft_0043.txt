taken the place of the old patriciate, while the rank and file of the
⁶ clientela' tended to absorb into itself the body of ⁶ ceorls’ or freemen.

On the great subjectos German religion and mythology little can
here be said except by way of explanation and criticism of Tacitus,
who, though much in advance of Caesar ¹, is yet meagre, and not easy
to reconcile with himself. German gods are known to him through
an ‘interpretatio Romana ²,' ready made to his hands, and without
any grounds of identification stated to uS, as Mercurius, Hercules,
Mars, Isis, Terra Mater, Mater desim, Castor and Pollux 3, nor are
we told clearly whether Hercules is god or hero, whether the great
goddess is one ot· three, on what ground the three gods named
together are selected for prominence, whether either of them is the
‘parent of the race,’ the ‘ruler of all things ⁴‚' whether the same was
everywhere supreme.

Sufficient resemblance is found in Celtic⁵ and German mythology
to point to a common origin. and in the supreme god of both races
the Romans recognize a ‘Mercurius⁶.’ Among the Germans this
must clearly be Wuodan, a god really of most complex and ubiquitous
attributes, with analogies both to the Varuna⁷ and to the India* of
the Vedas, and to other primitive conceptions of an elemental deity,
but no doubt more vividly present to Germans probably as the creator
of their race, certainly as ancestor of their kings⁹‚ and as the god
and hero of their advancement ¹⁰, both as a genius of war and father
of victories and wielder of the magio spear¹¹, and also as the culture
god, the instructor in learning and artS, the traveller, the magician,
and thus their Hermes, and no less their Prometheus, UlysseS, Orpheus,
Jason, probably (as shown below) their Hei-acles¹‘². His supremacy,
if of universal recognition, may not have been so from all time, but
