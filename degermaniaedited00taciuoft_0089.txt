CAP. 17, 18. 71

18. Dotem non uxor marito, sed uxori maritus offert.
intersunt parentes et propinqui ac munera probant, munera
non ad delicias muliebres quaesita nec quibus nova nupta
comatur, sed boves et frenatum equum et scutum cum framea

2 gladioque.

in haec munera uxor accipitur, atque in vicem 5

ipsa armorum aliquid viro adfert: hoc maximum vinculum,

3haec arcana sacra, hos coniugales deos arbitrantur.

mulier extra virtutum cogitationes extraque bellorum casus
putet, ipsis incipientis matrimonii auspiciis admonetur venire
se laborum periculorumque sociam, idem in pace, idem in proe- 10
lio passuram ausuramque: hoc iuncti boves, hoc paratus equus.

1. Dotem, &c. Tacitus is here car-
ried away by the apparent contrast to
Roman custom. The nature of the
actual gifts goes to show (what is fully
confirmed by other evidence), that they
were not a dowry to the wife, but a gift
(like the Homeric ἕδνα) to her parents,
purchasing her, or, more properly, pur-
chasing the ‘ patria potestas’ (‘ mund-
walt,' in mediaeval Latin ‘mundium ')
over her. The Gallie women had ‘ dos,'
and a kind of settlement in marriage
(Caes. 6.19, Ι).

2. intersunt parentes, &e The
family was summoned to approve the
betrothal and delivery of the wife.

munera probant, ‘ examine and ac-
cept the gifts.’ The repetition of ‘ mu-
nera ’ is considered by some an error of
the scn'be ; the anaphora of substantives
being rare in Tacitus, and confined to
contrasted parallel sentences (Dial. 13,
2; A· 1„ 7„ 7; 5945 4· 74, 3)- A prs·
cisely similar repetltlon of ‘ munera' is
found in Propert. 1. 3, 25.

3. non ad, &c., i. e. not jewels, nor
articles of the, toilet.

4. boves, &c. These are paid as
value,as in the case of fines (c. 1 2, 2),&c.

5. in haee munera, ⁶ with a view to
(‘under condition οἷ’) these gifts.' This
force of ‘in ' is seen in some passages
of Livy, as ‘in has . . . leges . . . ictum
goedus’ (23- 34, 1); also 34. 35, 1 ; 42.

not accurate. Records of ancient mar-
riage eustoms show that a sword‚ &c.,
was given to the bridegroom, not by
the bride, but by her father or guardian,
partly as a valuable present, but chiefly,
it would seem, as a symbol to denote
that she passed under his power.

mystic rites;’ alluding to the Roman
nearly obsolete (A. 4. 16, 2) ceremon)⁷

gifts stood to Germans instead of all this.

8. extra virtutum, &c. ‘excluded
from aspiring to share in manly heroic
deeds.'

9. auspiciis, ‘the initiatory cere-
monies.'

12. hoe . . . denuntiant, ‘give this
warning.' On the presence of women
in war, see c. 7, 3. It has been shown
above that these gists have probably no
such meaning.
