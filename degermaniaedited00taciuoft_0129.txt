Marbodui 6.

Silv. 3. 3, 170, and in Caes. 1. 51, 2;
but in Vell. 2. 108, 1 and others ‘Mar-
comanni.' The name is originally merely
an appellative,meaning ‘ dwellers on the
Mark ' (or borderlandW, and may be thus
indefinitely used when Caesar (1. l.) speaks
of them as with Ariovistus (see Momms.
Hist. iv. E. T. 252). Mf. somewhat dis-
sents from this view, and considers them
to have moved from the middle Elbe to
the upper Main, whence they were trans-
ferred by Maroboduus (Vell. l. l.) ‘to Bo-
hemia (see on 6. 28, 2), where he made
them the nucleus of his'great kingdom
(see ξ 2). In later times they and the
Quadi are chiefly known from their great
wars with M. Aurelius in A. 1). 167 and
for several years afterwards: see Mom ms.
v. E. T. i. 229, foll. They are known
to the end of the fourth century.

1. Quadi. These lived south-east of
the Marcomani, and are generally as-
sociated with them. Their territory
was on the Marus (March) and corre-
sponded to parts of Moravia and western
Hungary.

praecipua, predicate, as is also ‘ vir-
tute parta.’

2. pulsis, &c. not strictly correct, as
the Boii appear to have been driven out
before the immigration of the Marco-
mani: see Mommsen, Hist. E. T. iii.
174; iv. 2 32.

3. velut frons, i.e. these are as it
were the front presented by Germany.
Those on the Danube were more strictly
‘ a fronte ' to the Romans than those on
the Rhine.

4. praecingitur, ‘it is girdled'; so
most recent edd. Some retain ‘ per-

parata B b, text C 6 H S and edd. gene-
5. mansere Β. 6. Marabodui B,

agitur‚' giving it the force of ‘perfici-
tur ' (·‘so far as the srontier is formed ’).

6. Marobodui. In the later years
of Augustus this prince founded in Bo-
hemia, and the surrounding parts, the
nearest approach to a general monarchy
which Germany had seen, supported by
a force of 70‚000 foot and 4‚000 horse.
An attack on him led by Tiberius, in-
tended in A. D. 6, was frustrated by the
rebellion of Illyricum, and his power
lasted till A.D. 18, when he fell before
a coalition of Germans, and fied to Ti-
berius, and lived till A.D. 36 in custody
at Ravenna. His great power is de-
scribed in Vell. 2. 108, and by Tiberius
as quoted in A. 2. 62, 3. Mf. derives his
name from ‘ Marahpato ’ (Ἱππόμαχος).

Tudri. This king <apparently of the
Quadi) is nowhere else mentioned.

iam et: cp. 6. 15, 3.

externos, opposed to ‘ ex gente ipso-
rum'; from other German peoples. A
Quadian named Vannius had been set
up by the Romans on the fall of Maro—
boduus (A. 2. 63, ῖς 12. 29, 1), but
would not here be meant, as Tacitus is
speaking of his own times only, perhaps
of an intervention by Domitian, who
had some hostilities with the Marcomani
(Stat. l.l.). A race os kings among this
people is mentioned as late as the
fourth century.

7. vis et potentia, ‘material soree
and ascendency ' (nearly synonymsl.

ex auctoritate Romana, is derived
from Roman support.

8. pecunia, cp. c.15, 3.

nee minus, &c.‚ not less than if
helped by arms.
