PURPOSE OF THE YREA TISE 7

heroic courage of its people, and the blows which they had inflicted
on Rome during more than two hundred years without any substantia}
conquest of their territory 1, so as to force him to own, in words that
at the end of another century must have seemed prophetie, that only
the internal discords of the race could avert the destiny which was
hurrying the Roman empire to its destruction 2.

This ethical and political purpose, however insufficient to explain
the treatise as a whole, has powerfully influenced the treatment of
considerable portions3. In exhibiting to his readers the great free
people who alone among the nations had ever cast off the yoke once
laid upon them, and caused a distinct recession of the Roman frontier,
he would naturally use all his skill to idealize the vigorous and manly
qualities standing in the sharpest contrast to the enfeebling luxury
and vicious degradation of Roman contemporary life. Such con-
trasts for literary effect are especially sought by Tacitus throughout
his writings 4, and have often formed part of the common stock of
orators and poets, and such an idea had been already touched by
Horace⁵ in language showing a sufficiently close resemblance to the
thought of Tacitus to suggest some common source of both of themss.

‘Campestres melius Scythae,
Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos,
Vivum, et rigidi Getae,
Immetata quibus iugera liberas
Fruges et Cererem ferunt,
Nec cultura placet longior annua,
Defunctumque laboribus
Aequali recreat sorte vicarius.
Illic matre carentibus
Privignis mulier temperat innocens,
N ec dotata regit virum
Coniux nec nitido fidit adultero.
Dos est magna parentium
Virtus, et metuens alterius viri
Certo foedere castitas ;
lit peccare nefas aut pretium est mori.‘
