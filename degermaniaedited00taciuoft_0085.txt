1. electi, better than their own
usually were (c. 6, 3).

magna arma. Some would read
‘magnifica,’ or even ‘insignia ’ 3 but it is
easy to take it to mean massive shields
and cuirasses, suitable to their stature,
possibly also huge offensive weapons,
as spears and swords.

phalerae . . . torques. These em-
bossed plates or discs and collars are
often mentioned as military decorations
of Roman soldiers (Juv. 16, 60, &c.).

iam et, . . . docuimus, ‘we have now
even taught them’ (cp. c. 42, 2), as
a lesson of Roman avarice.

pecuniam. He is not-here speaking
of trade, as in c. 5, 5, but of bribes to
princes in Roman interest, as spoken of
in c. 42, 23 A. 11. 16, 3: cp. ‘pecuniam
et dona, quis solis corrumpantur' (H.
4. 76, 3). It has been thought that
some such aetion on the part of
Domitian may be here alluded to.

3. populis, dat. of agent, as in c. 31,
1, &e.

urbes: see Introd. p. 24.

4. colunt, &c.
posed that Tacitus means in this
passage to speak of two modes os
dwelling, the single houses altogether
separate, and the villages of houses still
(letached but more or less closely
grouped. There is reason to think that
there were at this time two classes of
villages, the dependent Xc. 25, 1 and
note) and the free (c. 26, 1 and note),
and it is possible that what he speaks of
first is in fact the former, but that the
house of the lord, built where he chose,
is alone mentioned (the huts of the serfs
being sufficiently insignifieant to be
ignored), and that he then goes on to

It is generally sup-‘

speak of the more important or free
villages, which alone he would probably
reckon as ‘ vici.’ It would seem that all
houses belonged in some sense to ‘ vici '
as centres of justice (e. 12, 3).

disereti ae diversi, ⁴ separated and
in various plaees⁷: ep. ‘ si. . . diversi
inrupissent ' (H. 3. 46, 3).

5. ut fons, &c. SS. notices the
frequeney in German names of such
terminations as ‘ brunnen‚’ ‘ feld‚’ ‘ berg,'
‘ wald,' &e

vicos locant, ‘they lay out their
villages.’ The description here given
would mark a soeial stage far above
that of Caesar's time, who makes the
Germans (6. 22, 2) have no fixed
dwellings at all (see on c. 26, 2). The
account of Caesar was perhaps even
then true only of some tribes of more
wandering life. He is thought to have
known most of the Suebi (see on c. 38,
Ι), whom he describes separately (4.
1—4).

7. spatio, ·' a homestead‚' garden,
χορτός, ‘ hortus,' surrounded by a fence.

8. remedium, in apposition with the
sentence.

inscitia (causal ablj), so with
genit. in Agr. 28, 4, &e A far more
probable reason than either of these is
to be found in the German love of
independence. From these words he is
led to speak of their mode of building.

caementorum . . . tegularum. This
is confirmed by the absence of genuine
German names for these and the use os
words of Latin origin, as ‘ cement' and
⁵ tile' (‘ Ziegel'). The primitive roos
would be os straw or rushes, as was that
of the Gauls (Caes. 5. 43, 1). ‘Cae-
menta,' rough stone (opp. to ‘ matoria ’>.
