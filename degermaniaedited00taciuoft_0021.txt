discarded Ciceronian rotundity‚ and required its speakers to be terse,
epigrammatic, and striking¹‚ tolerant ofG1-aecisms2, and enriching
their phraseology from the treasury of Classical poetry or by original·
inventions of their own.

Of the practice of seeking effect by novelty of diction we have
such instances as ‘eiectamenta' (c. 45, 5 , ‘improcerus’ (c. 5, 1),
‘inlaborare' (c. 46, 5), ‘inlacessitus' (c. 36, 1, also in Agr), pro-
bably ‘praetracto' (c. 11, 1), and some words apparently here first
used in prose, as ‘feralis’ (c. 43, 6), ‘inexhaustus' (c. 20, 3, and in
Hist.), ‘monstrator' (c. 21, 2), &c., but we have not yet such archaic
revivals as ‘claritudo' and ‘necessitudo ² substituted for the Ciceronian
‘claritas’ (6. 34, 2) and ‘necessitas' (c. 15, 2), nor does he as yet
prefer ‘ cupido' to ⁶ cupiditas ' (c. 19, 4; 35, 3), nor ‘ dum’ to ‘duin-
modo' (6. 6, 6). The poetical use, so frequent in the Annals, of
simple verbs for compound, is here sparing: there are isolated in-
stances (for example) of ‘ clarescere' (c. 14, 3, also in Dial.)‚ ‘cludere’
(c. 45, 6), ‘firmare’ (c. 39, 1), ‘monstratus' (c. 31, 4), ‘vocare'
(c. 14, 5), on the other hand we have ‘adsuescere' (c. 4, 3), not
‘suescere,' ‘evalescere' (c. 28, 1), not ‘valescere,‘' and the v'erbal
substantive ‘apparatus ' (0. 14, 4; 23, 1), not ‘paratns³.'

In the diction as a whole we have not the same general straining
after compression which becomes afterwards so characteristic os him,
though we are not without signal examples of it. It would be hard
to find even in his latest works expressions so harsh from their brevity
as ‘vallare noctem' (c. 30, 2), to say less of ‘non in alia vilitate’
(c. 5, 4), ‘virgines festinantur' (c. 20, 3), ‘ius parendi' (c. 44, 3),
‘regia utilitas ’ (c. 44, 4), ‘frumenta laborare’ (c. 45, 4), &o We have
again, though sparingly, some of his favourite ellipses, as of ⁶ sit’ or
‘sint’ (c. 13, 3, &c.), of ‘magis’ (c. 6, 6), of ‘non solum ' before ‘sed
et' (c. 17, 33 45, 4: in c. 35, 2 the full expression is used), or of
‘et ’ or ‘etiam ' after the former (6. 10, 5), or of similar words (c. 10. 1).
To set against these, it may be noted among syntactical usages that
we have here a solitary and not strong instance of the concise expres-
sion of purpose by the gerundive dative (c. 1 1, 2), while the still more

¹ Dial. c. 19-20. ‘ pretia nascendi rettulisse ’ (c. 31, 2).

² Tacitus in all his writings uses such ³ In the Annals, and to some extent
very sparingly: in the Germania we may in the Histories‚ it will bc found that
note the construction ‘ est videre’ [c. 6, what is here noted as occasional is more
4⁸, ‘ex aequo ἕξει 36, 3, also in Liv.)‚ frequent, and that what is licre noted as

and ‘ conferre armentorum aut frugum' absent is also common. ‘Paratus’ i>-
(c. 15, 2), also the Greek expression used once in Agr. (25, 3).
