1. consilium C c.

Such applause is noted in H. 5. 17, 5,
and, as a Gallie custom, by Caesar [7.
21, Ι).

1. Licet . . . accusare quoque, i.e.
the ‘ concilium' has judicial as well as
deliberative functions. He speaks ex-
clusively of grave criminal charges,
first of such as would involve capital
punishment, then of others (ξ 2); but
it is not clear whether he means
that such could also be brought, at
the option of the accuser, before the
local tribunals. The expression ‘iura
reddunt ' (ξ 3) seems to speak rather of
the function of the latter as that of civil
jurisdiction. In later times the chief
judicial centre is the ‘hundred’ (see
Introd. p. 23).

2. intendere, ‘to threaten,' so with
‘accusationem' (A. 6. 4, 2), ‘crimen'
(Liv. 9. 26, 11), &c. ·

distinctio, &c., ‘ penalties are distin-
guished according to (c. 3, 4) the crime.⁷
It is probable that specimens only are
given. Other punishments in time of
war are noted (c. 7, 2), and there was
also for the escaped criminal that of
outlawry, in which he was liable to be
hunted down as a wolf.

proditores et transfugas, ‘ traitors
and deserters'; those who betrayed
them to the enemy or went over to him.

3. arboribus. It is noted that par-
ticular, especially leafiess trees, were
chosen for the purpose, and that the
execution was a sacrificial act. Cp. the
old Roman law ‘infelici arbore reste
suspendito' (Liv. 1. 26, 6).

ignavos et imbelles, ‘weaklings and
cowards.' The words are so coupled in
c.31, 23 Agr. 15, 33 Liv. 26. 2, 11;
and are nearly synonymous3 the former
being opposed to ‘fortis' or ‘strenuos’
(Agr. 3ο, 2 ; A. 2. 46, 4), and the latter
being also used of cowards (H. 4. 80, 3,

7. poenarum (pen) all, text Acid.

δία), often merely of non-combatants
rA3 4- 49, 3; 13· 54, 23 56, 6 &e.,.
It 1s obv1ous that all cowardice was not
thus punished (cp. c. 6, 63 14, 2, &c.);
the meaning is that when the extreme
penalty was inflicted (perhaps especially
in the case of defaulters from military
service), it took this form.

4. caeno ac palude, ‘in mire and
swamp.’ SS. notes also traces of early
German custom of putting women to
death by drowning in such placeS.

iniecta crate. This mode ofdrown-
ing is given by Livy in a tradition
respecting Tarquinius Superbus [1. 51,
9), and called ‘novum genus leti.⁷ He
gives another instance in 4. 50, 4; and
it is represented also as used by Cartha-
ginians (plaut. Poen. 5. 2, 65). ⁴ Insuper '
seems here best taken to mean ‘over-
head‚' as perhaps in c. 16, 4.

5. illuc respicit, tamquam, ‘looks
to the distinction that '; cp. the similar
sentence in c. 39, 4, and the frequent
use of ‘tamquam ' to express the ground
assigned for an action by the agents or
attributed to them (c. 20, 4; 22, 3, &c.‘.

scelera . . . . flagitia. These terms
are often not distinguished, bnt the
latter is especially used of self outrage
(cp. A. 15. 37, 8; 16. 19, 5, Sco), and
would thus especially apply to the
‘ corpore infame& and possibly to the
coward as distinct from the traitor.
The ‘ scelera ' are here especially offences
against the ⁴ pat1·ia.’

6. sed et = ‘ sed etia1n.' This passage
is a note, like that in c. 3, 1.

7. levioribus. These include homi-
cide (c. 21, 1'.

pro modo, sc. ‘ delicti' (‘ propor-
tional '). All recent edd. read ‘poena ' :
the word has here the force of ‘ multa ” ;
and old German laws show an elaborate
system ofsuch compositions for offences.
