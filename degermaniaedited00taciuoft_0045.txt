THE ACCOUNJ· GJVEN BV TACITUS 29

as a mere prefix of greatness ¹, at others as a cognomen of Tiu ², and
who has been thought with great probability to be no more than
Wuodan conceived as a warrior 3.

We perhaps find some form of a widespread Aryan worship in
their Castor and Pollux 4, and another familiar idea in the ‘ persuasio ⁷
of the sungod's chariot⁵; there are one or two more deities whom
neither Romans nor moderns have identified ⁶, and here our know-
ledge, so far as it can be based on Tacitus, ends ⁷, except for an
important statement regarding all, namely, that none had temples or
any other places of worship than the gloom of hallowed groves, and
that none were ever represented under any visible image, but all only
worshipped as spiritual beings and as discerned by faithss, a statement
at variance certainly with all later information, and hard to reconcile
with their strongly anthropomorphic mythology, but so far in aecor--
(lance with other parallel evidence ⁰ as to appear worthy of belief, when
due allowance is made for rhetorical colouring.

On the subject of priests and sacrifices Tacitus is again in advance
of Caesar, who was perhaps influenced by the contrast of the Gauls 10.
The Germans had clearly no such hierarchy as the Druids ;' the priest
is but the minister of the gods 1¹, and only reads the signs, as the
⁸ pater familiae ' also does ¹² ; yet besides his functions in worship, the
religious relations of civil life give him a position distinct from and

gods represented as in any way mutu-
ally related, except the brothers of c.

‘³ As ‘Tamfana’ (A. 1. 51, 2 ‚ and
·’ Baduhenna’ (A. 4. 73, 7). The former
is thought by Muellenhoff to have been
Frigg, and to have been worshipped
with Wuodan by the Istaevones. There
is also evidence of the cultus of Nymphs,
perhaps the Valkyries, in the name
Idisiaviso (A. 2. 16, 1).

⁷ It should be noted here that the
whole system as known to Tacitus is
simple in the extreme as compared
with the theogony of gods and their
wives, and gods sprung from gods, ancl
all the complex mythology known to
us from other evidence. With him,
earth by herself is the primaeval parent,
and her offspring‚ a deity of both sexeS,
is sole progenitor of the eponymi of
the principal subdivisions of the racc

⁹ Herodotus describes the early
Persians (Ι. 131) as ἀγάλματα καὶ νηοὺς
καὶ βωμοὺς οὐκ ἐν νόμῳ ποιευμένους
ἱδρύεσθαι . . . ὅτι οὐκ ἀνθρωποφυέας
ἐνόμισαν τοὺς θεούς. It is also noted
that the Scandinavians had originally
no images of their gods, and that the
Greeks probably first got theirs from
the Phoenicians. Fetishes of some kind,
such as meteoric stones‚ were probably
in use much earlier, and the ‘ numen ' os
01640, 5, may well have been such.

the tribe to the ‘pater familiae' in the
household (c. 10, 2). Special priests of
particular gods are mentioned in c. 40, 2 ς

German priesthood, see Grimm, Mythol.
