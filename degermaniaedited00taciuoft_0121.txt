Scaurus, consular legate of Mallius (see
below), was defeated, taken prisoner,
and put to death in Gaul, in B.C. 105
<Liv. Epit. 67).

Servilio caepione Gnaeoque Mal-
lio. The latter name is corrected
from inscriptions (Or. 3697, δῖα), and
from Plutarch (Mar. 19). Cn. Mallius
Maximus, consul of the year, and Q.
Servilius Caepio, consul ofthe preceding
year and then proconsul,were successively
defeated at Arausio (Orange‘) on the
Rhone in B.C. 105. The Romans are
said to have lost 80,000 soldiers and
40,000 camp-followers, and to have
sustained a greater material and moral
defeat than even that of Cannae.

1. quinque. To make up this num-
ber, the legatus Scaurus (see above is
treated as an independent general.

war.

Caesari. There was no need to
specify the Caesar under whom this
happened. The dictator is thus called
simply ‘ Caesar' in H. 3. 66, 5.

3. impune, ‘ without loss.’

in Italia, on the Raudian plain,
near Vercellae, in uc. 101. The name
of his colleague Catulus is not given,
nor is any mention made of the defeat
of the Teutons, who took part in the
same movement, at Aquae Sextiae in
Gaul, B.c. 102.

in Gallia, alluding to his defeat of
the German king Ariovistus in ΒΕ. 58
(1. 30-54), and his expulsion of the
Usipetes and Tencteri in ΒΕ. 55 [4.
1-15) : his expeditioris across the Rhine

(4. 16-19; 6. 9 foll.) are omitted, and
were really unimportant.

4. Drusus, the brother of Tiberius,
B.C. 12-9. In these campaigns he
subdued a considerable territory and
reached the Elbe.

Ner-03 so Tiberius Caesar is named
before his adoption. The nine cam-
paigns which he claims to have con-
ducted in Germany {see A. 2. 26, 3, and
note) fall between B.c. 9 and A.D. 11.

Germanicus, the son of Drusus and
adopted son of Tiberius: his campaigns
in A. D. 14—16 are fully related in Ann.
1 and 2. His successes were indecisive,
and involved much Roman loss (‘nec
impune‘).

5. mox (cp. c. 2, 2) ingentes, δίο.
Tacitus speaks similarly of the ‘ Gaia·
narum expeditionum ludibrium' (H. 4.
15, 3): cp. also Agr. 13, 4. Suet.

which the emperor’s own German guard

to mention Corbulo’s doings (A. 11.

donec, &c. The rising headed by
the Batavian Julius Civilis, Α.1). 69-
70, is meant. He assumed at first the
character of a partizan of Yespasian,
and then threw off the mask. The
winter camp of the legions taken by
him was that of Castra Vetera near
Xanten on the lower Rhine. The
organizers of a revolt of some important
Gallic tribes made common cause with
him. The whole is related in Hist. 4

and 5.
