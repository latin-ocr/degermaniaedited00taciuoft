of the Thracians, from whom the Greeks
adopted it.

Sarmatis, the Σαυρομάται of Hdt.
&c.‚ a name used by some writers more
definitely, but by others generally
applied to the Scythic peoples of north-
western Europe. Those here meant
are chiefly the Iazyges Sarmatae, who
had driven out the Dacians from the
region between the Danube and the
Theiss (Pl. N. H. 4. 12, 25, 80; cp. A.
12. 29, 4; H. 3. 5, 23 Strab. 7. 3, 17,
3061. It is, however, plain that Tacitus
considered the eastern neighbours of the
Germans to be generally Sarmatian
c. 46, Ι).
< Dacis. This people, whose name
takes the place of that of the Getae,
are generally supposed to have been a
Thracian race, though some have made
them Germanic. At the date of this
treatise they were formidable and un-
subdued enemies of Rome, but were
conquered a few years later by Trajan.
The only people reckoned as German
on whom they bordered were the Bas-
tarnae (see c. 46, 1).

mut-uo metu aut montibus, i.e.
partly by the one, partly by the other
(cp. ‘fluminibus aut silvis,’ c. 40, 1).
Such a combination of physical and
moral ideas is noted in c. 7, 4, also in
H. 2. 4, 5 ,K‘arduo opere ob ingenium
montis et pervicaciam superstitionis ’);
and such rhetorical alliterations are
frequent, especially in these treatises
(Introd. p. 10). The ‘ montes' (part of
the Carpathians) separate the German
Bastarnae from the Dacians ; against the
Sarmatians there is no natural frontier.

1. cetera, the north and north—west.

sinus: if gulfs of the sea, as the
Baltic and its recesses‚ are meant, ⁴ com-
plectens ³ must be here taken by zeugma.
in the sense of ‘efficiens'3 but it is
probable that projections of land (cp. c.
37, 1; Agr. 23, 2, &c.), such as the

‘ ingens flexus' of c. 35, 1, are intended.

2. insularum inmensa spatia: here
‘ inmensa’ only means ‘ permagna ' (cp.
c. 6, 2; Agr. 10, 43 23, 2, &e.). The
whole Scandinavian peninsula was then
supposed to be an island (see on c. 44, 2),
and is no doubt here chiefly meant;
though many others were known (see
next note).

nuper cognitis, &c. The abl.
abs., as often in Tacitus, has the force
of a causal sentence r ‘ since there have
recently become known,' Βία). ‘ Ν uper'
must be taken with much latitude (cp.
H. 4. 17, 7, &c.]‚ as the reference can-
not be to any later event than to the
campaign of Tiberius in A.D. 5, when
the army reached the Elbe, and the fleet
explored the west coast of Jutland (see
Mon. Anc. v. 14—183 Pl. H. N. 2. 67,
167), and may have come within sight
of Scandinavia. Pliny speaks (4. 13,
27, 97) of twenty-three islands west of
Jutland as ‘ Romanis armis cognitae '3
instancing Burcana (Borkum> and others.

3. gentibus ao regibus, probably
not to be taken as ‘ free states and mon·
archies,' but rather ‘states and their
kings'3 kingly rule being apparently
prevalent in those remote parts of Ger-
many: see c. 44, 13 3; 45, 9; &c.

aperuit, ‘has disclosed to view’:
cp. the similar personification ‘annus
. . . aperuit’ (Agr. 22, 1).

Rhenus, &c. He returns here to
the two best known boundaries. The
source of the Rhine is in Mt. St. Gotthard
(probably the Ἀδούλας of Strabo and
Ptolemy), which may be included in the
‘Alpes Raeticae‚' widely taken. The
account os its course may be compared
with that given in Caes. 4. 10, 2, and
Plin. 4. 15, 28, 101.

5. versus, middle, ‘turning’ Some
take the description to refer to the bend
at Arnheim‚ others better of its general
direction throughout its course.
