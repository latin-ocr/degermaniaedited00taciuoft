De Germania. The real title of this
work is very uncertain. Besides those
given by the MSS„ ‘ de situ Germaniae’
is suggested by Reifferscheid, ‘de situ
ac populis Germaniae' by Wolfflin.
The lost dissertation in Livy, Which
Tacitus may have followed (see Introd.
p. 13), is described in the Epitome as
containing ‘ situm Germaniae moresque.'

1. Germania omnis. Tacitus here
excludes from Germany proper the
Romanized ‘ Germaniae ’ within the
Rhine (the people of which are, how-
ever, noted in c. 28, foll.) and the ‘agri
decumates ' (c. 29, 4), apparently imitat-
ing Caesar, whose ‘ Gallia omnis ' (B. G.
1. 1, Ι) excludes the provincia Narbo-
nensis. On his general geographical
view, see Introd. p. 13, foll.

Raetia, thus corrected from the
MSS. text3 Raetia being only a single
province. It included also Vindelicia
(which extended to the Danube and
⁴ limes’), and the name of the people
seems here loosely taken to include the
people of Noricum (c. 5, 1), which was
a separate province. The people of
these provinces (answering generally to
parts of Bavaria, Austria, and the Tyrol)

were (as regards Noricum and Vinde—
licia) mainly Celtic, but the Raeti had
great linguistic affinity to the Etruscans
(see Momms. Hist. i. E. T. p. 128).

que et, coupling the two Danubian
peoples closely, as distinct from the
Gauls on the Rhine frontier.

Pannoniis. The province of Pan-
nonia bordered on the Danube from
Vienna to Belgrade, and is often (with
the neighbouring province of Delmatia)
called Illyricum. The Illyrian race are
represented in modern times by the
Albanians or Arnauts. On their lan-
guage see note on c. 43, 1.

Rheno. This river-name is gener-
ally taken to be Celtic < the running ’),
with an inserted ‘h‘ from the Greek
form. Holzmann traces it to a root
common also to other Aryan languages.

2. Danuvio. This form, generally
taken to be correct for all Classical
Latin, is established in Tacitus by the
Medicean MSS. of Ann. and Hist. The
name is the Romanized form of a Celtic
word ‘g‘ rapid ’), whence the German
‘'suonouwe,’<Mf.) ‘Donau.’ The name
‘Ister' or ‘ l-Iister,’ given to this river in
its lower course, belongs to the language
