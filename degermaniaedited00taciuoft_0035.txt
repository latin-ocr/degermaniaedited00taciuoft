THE ACCOUNT GJVEN BV TACJTUS 21

non in the choice of a king, conferred otherwise no political privi-
lege¹, and that no other rulers of the people were necessarily chosen
from its ranks. Such rulers or magistrates are designated as ‘prin-
cipes,’ and are described as chosen by the ‘concilium’ of the state
to preside judicially in its local subdivisions² (see below, p. 23).
They are probably the same who collectively form an inner council
or senate'ss, to decide lesser matters and to hold previous debate on
greater, before their submission to the general body ; and who dele—
gate one of their number to the supreme command in war 4. They
are probably, again, the same who are spoken of as partly supported
by quasi-voluntary gifts ⁵, and as having the important privilege of
keeping up and leading to battle a train of ‘comites' (see below,
p. 25). In this description, as far as it goeS, we clearly recognize
the person known later as ‘heretoga‚' ⁶ herzog,’ or ‘ duke’ in war, and
as ‘ ealdorman' or ‘graf’ in peace ⁶3 however wide the gulf that sepa-
rates the freely-chosen magistrates of a democracy from those who in
later times are chosen by the king, are hereditary‚ and often take the
title of the ‘Earl’ or ‘ jarl⁷.’

Below the plebs of ‘ingenui’ are the unfreess, respecting whom
Tacitus seems to be betrayed into inaccuracy in his anxiety to point
a contrast to Rome. Domestic slaves may probably not have been
numerous, so that he ignores thern altogether where we should most
expect him to mention them 9, and describes to us only an extremely
mitigated form of bondage on the land, or serfdom, which he compares
to the condition of a Roman ‘colonus ¹⁰,' representing the bondsman
as living in his own house on his allotted parcel of land, subject only

¹ See Bp. Stubbs, Const. Hist. i. pp.
22, 30 It would seem, however, that
the‘ nobiles’ had lar ger shares of land
(cp. ‘secundum dignationem partiuntur,'
e. 26, Ι), and that the‘ principes’ as a
fact were usually, if not always of noble
birth. Also the noble’s‘ wergild' (see
on c. 21, 1) was higher than a simple
sreeman's (Kemble, 278).

² 1t seems best to assume that this
term, when used in the plural, uniformly
designates these persons in this treatise.
It is, however, taken by some, in some
places, to be only equivalent to ‘ pro-
ceres‚’ or the more eminent of the ⁵ no-
biles.'

³ e. 1 1, 1. This sunction,very slightly
touched, is very important in history;
this senate being apparently the origin

of the‘ witan gemot’ as distinct from
the‘ folkmoot' (Bp. Stubbs, p. 133, foll.,)
and through it, of the English House of
Peers.

¹⁰ This eomparison would in any
sense (see note) make him free, except
that he could not change his land or
his lord: but the latter part of the
chapter materially qualifies this xiew,
showing that the master had the usual
despotic powers, though he did not osten
exercise them.
