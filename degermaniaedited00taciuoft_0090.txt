72 CORNELI] TACITI DE GERMANJA

nurus accipiant rursusque ad nepotes referantur.

cebris, nullis conviviorum irritationibus corruptae.

suits the context, but weakens the con-
trast, unless it is preserved by altering
‘vivendum' to ‘nubendum' with B'ah-
rens.

1. accipere . . . accipiant, repeated
to denote the extension of duty. Itis
not, of course, the gists themselves, but
the idea conreyed by them, that is to
be thus treasured and transmitted.

digna, not connected with the follow-
ing ‘ quae,' but taken absolutely, in the
sense of ⁶ prizeworthy.'

quae, in double construction, as ob-
ject of ·’ accipiant,' and subject of ⁴' refe-
rantur? Or. gives nearly similar instances
from Sallust.

3. Ergo, i.e. because of the obliga-
tion accompanying these presents.

saepta, ‘ well-protected’: cp. ‘ omnia
pudore saepta' (Liv. 3. 44, 4).

agunt, ‘ se gerunt 'z cp. c. 29, 33 46,
1, &o

nullis, &c. ‘ with no shows to corrupt
them by their allurements‚ no banquets
by their incentives.’ The corrupting
influence of shows upon women is often
noted: see Prop. 2. 19, 9; ΟΥ. A. A. I,
97—100; Juv. 11, 2013 and many other
passages collected in Friedl'ander, Sit-
tengeschichte, i. 432, foll. The Roman
banquets and their accompaniments are
also often spoken of as demoralizing:
cp. Ov. l.l. 229; Quint. 1. 2, 83 and
other references in Friedl. l.l. 435, foll.

4. litterarum secreta, ‘the secrecy
of correspondence.' The allusion is
plainly to the clandestine love-letters
of Roman ladies (Juv. 6, 277); but it is
perhaps pressing the words too sar to
make thern mean that the art of writing
was altogether unknown to Germans.
Letters ostheir princes to the emperor or
senate are spoken ofin A. 2.63‚ 13 88, 1.

5. in tam numerosa, ‘though the
race is so numerous '2 cp. ‘quamquam
in tanto . . . numero' (c. 4, 2).

6. praesens, ‘immediate';
‘supplicium ’·in A. 1. 38, Ι.

7. abscisis 3 so Halm, Z.‚ Mf„ Mr. :
‘ accisis' is retained by others, with the
sense of ‘cut short.' Long hair was
characteristic of Germans generally (see
c. 38, 2), and especially of the women.
Orelli cites old German laws attesting
all these penalties‚ ancl others more
severe, that of death (even by burn-
ing] being permissible. Unchastity
among unmarried women could be
similarly punished by the parent οι·
guardian.

eoram propinquis. These act as
his assessors in the trial. A similar
family tribunal to try the wife was re-
cognized in Roman law even under the
Empire‚ as is shown in the case of
Pomponia Graecina (A. 13. 32, 3).

8. publicatae enim, &c As the sub-
sequent sentences still relate to married
life, it would be supposed that he is
here also speaking of the adulteress,
and saying that she could never hope
sor a second marriage, which, if rich or
beautiful, she might easily contract at
Rome. This seems weak after what
has gone before, whence it is better per-
haps to suppose that hc means here to
speak, as it were parenthetically, of the
unmarried. Those who so take it either
omit or bracket ‘enim‚’ or alter it to
‘etiam,’ or ‘enim vero,’ or give it an
elliptical meaning: i. e. ‘ no wonder that
the penalty for adultery is so severe,
for unchastity generally (even among
the unmarried) finds no pardon.’ It
would still appear that Tacitus was not
fully aware of the severity of the penal—
