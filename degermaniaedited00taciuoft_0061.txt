1, &c.), and ‘ natio ' sometimes widely
(cp. c. 4, Ι). From comparison of ‘ in
tumultum evaluit’ (H. 1. 80, 3), some
would here read ‘ in ’ sor ‘non.'

1. avietore. The prep. is best taken
in the sense of ὑπό, not ἀπό, answering
to ‘a seipsis' below. Tacitus is seek-
ing to explain how the name ‘ Germani,'
originally applied to the CisRhenane‚
came to be extended to the TransRhe-
nane peoples (‘ omnes'fs. The former
desired to stn‘ke terror into the Gauls,
whom they had dispossessed, by repre-
senting the whole race beyond the Rhine
as their kinsmen‚ and having no other
common name to apply to them called
them by the newly devised name which
they had themselves assumed, and this
name the latter also (as these authori-
ties suppose) adopted. ‘ Ob metum '
has certainly thus a very opposite sense
to its elsewhere invariable meaning,
‘ by reason of sear,‘ ⁶ because they were
afraid’ (A. 1. 1, 53 68, 2; H. 2. 49, 63
65, 3, &c.] ; but ‘ ob ' is used in a final
sense in other nearly parallel expres-
sions, as ‘ ob praedam ’ (H. 1.63, Ι, &c.),
‘ob praemium' (A. Ι. 3, 6, &c.), ‘ob
id' (A. 13, 5, 2), &c. Some have altered
‘victore ² to ‘ victo,' others make the
words mean that the Gauls ‘ by reason
of their sear called all the others after
the name of the victor ': but these seem
to lead to still greater difficulties.

2. a seipsis, taken closely with ⁶ vo-
carentur.’ There does not seem to be
any sufficient evidence that the Germans
beyond the Rhine really called them-
selves by this name collectively.

3. Fuisse . . . memorant. From the
use of ‘eos' most commentators infer
that the subject is the ‘quidam ' of the
last chapter; but the change in ‘ canunt ’
would be thus so awkward, that it seems
better to take the subject to be ‘ Ger-
mani,' as in ‘celebrant ’ [c. 2, 3), and to
suppose this to be a stronger instance of
such use of ‘is’ for the reflexive as is

&c.

Herculem. The personality here
mentioned as sung of before battle as'the
‘prototype of brave men,' and whose
achievements are thus held up as the
pattern to warriors, seems to differ from
that conceived as one of the great gods
in c. 9, 1 (where see note); but it is
to be observed, that the divine and
heroic type are strongly intermingled
in German mythology. On the whole
subject see Introd. pp. 27, 28, and note
on c. 34, 2.

4. sunt illis, &c.
‘intumescat' we have what in modern
writing would be a footnote‚ describing
not apparently the warsongs before
spoken of (‘canunt'). but something
suggested by and to be *distinguished
from them, a kind of battle chant called
loosely ‘carmina,' beginning probably
with some sentences or words but ending
evidently in inarticulate eries like the
ἀλαλητός; cp. ‘cantu truci' (H. 2. 22,
2; also 4. 18, 5.); ‘laeto cantu aut
truci sonore’ (A. 1. 65, 1 .

5. haee. Much of the difficulty of
the passage lies in this pronoun. If it
be taken as = ‘ea,' ‘talia,' ί eiusmodi,'
we should expect a subjunctive ; and the
alternative interpretation, ‘those well
known‚⁷ would seem to require ‘illa'
(the parallel cited from c. 20, 1 being

unsatisfactory.
