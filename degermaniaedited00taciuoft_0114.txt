96 CORNELII TACJTJ DE GERMANJA

(‘Angar'), and it is thought to survive
in that of Enger near Herford.

narratur. The expression would
show that Tacitus is not speaking from
personal knowledge. This verb is
rarely used with acc. and inf.: cp.
‘ aves tunc siluisse narratur ' (Pl. N. H.
3511, 38.121).

pulsis, &c., at some unknown date
after A.D. 70: Vestricius Spurinna set
up a king over them about the date of
this treatise, at which time they are
still called warlike (Pl. Ep. 2. 7, 2),
and mention occurs of them down to
the eighth century : ‘ excisis ’ is there-
fore exaggerated.

2. odio, &c., causal ablativejoined to
the instrumental ‘consensu' (‘ by the
common action').

3. ne spectaculo quidem, &C.,
‘ they did not even grudge us the sight
of a battle ' t ⁴ spectaculo ' is probably
to be taken as dat. (the usual classical
construction), though Tacitus uses ‘in-
video' with abl. in A. 1. 22, 2. Cp.
‘invidit operi' (A. 13. 53, 4). He
speaks as if some Roman force was
watching the event of the conflict. .

5. oblectationi oculisque, ‘for
them to be delighted by, and to be-
hold ⁷ (dat. of purpose and hendiadys).
The terrible inhumanity of the senti—
ment may be partly due to a Roman’s
fondness for gladiatorial shows,⁴ but
much more to the sense of security to
the empire in the quarrels of its foes:
cp. Agr. 12, 23 A. 2. 62, 13 Liv. 2.
40, 13.

maneat; so used in aspiration or
prayer in A. 3. 55, 6.

7. quando, ‘ since ⁷ ; so often in Liv.‚
occasionally in Cic. and Sall.

urguentibus imperii fatis, ‘ while
the destinies of the empire drive it on.'
The resemblance to Livy 5. 36, 6 (‘ iam
urgentibus Romanam urbem fatis ') and
Luc. 10, 29 (⁶ fatis urgentibus actus'),
and other passages, supports this read—
ing as against ‘vergentibus' (which
could hardly be so used) or ‘ ingruen-
tibus' (more properly used of force,
&c., than of destiny) ς but the ‘iam'
added in the best MSS. can hardly
stand unless it is omitted below. The
allusion seems to be to the danger
which he foresaw might arise from the
people of the hardy north to the corrupt
and degenerate civilization of Rome.
It is possible that a grave crisis had
been threatened in A.D. 88 by the in-
tended, but accidentally frustrated, com-
bination of Germans (probably Chatti)
with the rebellion of Antonius Satur-
ninus against Domitian (Suet. Dom. 6).
The date of this work makes it im-
possible to suppose (with Orelli) that
the reference is to the dangerous exten-
sion of the empire by Trajan.

9. a tergo, to the east.

Dulgubnii, the Δουλγούμνιοι of
Ptol. 2. 11, 17. The name has been
thought to mean ‘ wounders,’ and their
situation may probably have been be-
tween the Cherusci and Langobardi in
part of Hanover near Zell, on the Leine
and Aller. Some place thern further
west.

Chasuarii, the Κασουάροι of Ptol.
2. 11, 22, but probably not the Χατ-
τουάριοι of Strab. 7. Ι, 4, 292. If the
