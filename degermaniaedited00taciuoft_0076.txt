contrast to ‘proprium gentis'3 but as
Tacitus would hardly state so obvious
3 fact, it is probable that ‘ hic ' means
‘in Germany,' and is used as in 0. 3, 3Ϊ
because ‘illud' had immediately pre-
ceded. The antithesis 111 thought would
still remain: ‘it is known among them
also how to divine from birds. but their
distinctive practice is,⁷ &c.

the direction of their flight. ’

person answering to the king in king-
less states, as also a ‘princeps Chatto-
rum' (see note on Introd. p. 19) seems
spoken of as if 110 was one, and not
merely one of many; but the authority
of Caesar, borne out by much later evi-
dence also (see on Introd. p. 20, note IN,
would go to show that many such
states had no single ruler in peace time.
It has been thought that the ‘princeps ’
of the most prominent ‘pagus' had
some preeminence; it is possible also
that in many states constant war with
Rome, or the sear of it, had made the
‘ dux' 10. 7, 1). more permanent; pos-
sibly also, in states normally under
kings, where no fit person of such 00111-
manding lineage as to deserve the title
(see c. ’7, 1) existed, a ‘Fiirst’ was
sometimes chosen instead from some
wider area, differing from him in little
but title. We have again ‘rex vel
princeps ' in c. 11, 5, and it seems prob-
31110 that ‘princeps' is used for the
ruler of the state in 0. 5, 4; 15, 2 ; 22, 3.

hinnitusque, &e.: probably it was
3 good omen if they neighed, and a bad
one if they did not.

8. sed. inserted by most edd„ as Taci-
tus, though he often, after ‘ non solum ³ or
‘non modo,’ omits either ‘sed’ (A. 3.
19, 2, &c.) or ‘ 0113111’,Α.1.60, Ι, 800),
never elsewhere omits both. If, 11011·-
ever, the reading ‘apud sacerdotes' be
retained, the emphatic climax makes
the omission more tolerable.

proceres, probably 3 wider term
than ‘principes⁷: see Introd. p. 20,
