triumphati. The use of this passive
originates from Augustan poets (Verg.
Aen. 6. 8373 Hor. Od. 3. 3, 43, &csta

3. Suebis. The name is read by
edd. in this form, against the MSS. of
this treatise (see crit. note on c. 2, 4), as
attested for Tacitus by Med. I. (in A.
1. 44, 6) and Med. II (H. 1. 2, 3, &c.)‚
and otherwise best supported. Tacitus
had given the name as generic in c. 2,
4; and here takes it very widely and
probably inaccurately as including all
those mentioned from this point (cp. c.
46, Ι). Caesar speaks of them (4. Ι,
3) as the greatest German people, con-
sisting of 100 pagi, each of which sent
out 1000 wa rriors yearly with a similar
reserve at home. These may be the
Semnones of Tacitus (cp. c. 39, 4)) but
appear geographically to answer to the
Chatti (ep. 6. 10, 5> ; while the Suebic
subjects of Ariovistus appear to have
dwelt between the upper Rhine and
Danube. Strabo 7. 1, 3, 290) makes
them spread from the Rhine to the
Elbe, and further. With Pliny <see on
c. 2, 3) the Suebi (perhaps Semnones)
are grouped with Chatti and others
under the Herminones. Also a Suebic
ofsshoot was planted by Augustus in
Flanders near the mouth of the Scheldt

3. sueuis all, see on

(see Agr. 28, 4, and note). The
probable explanation of this great
vagueness is that the name, meaning
‘wanderers' (connected with ‘schwe-
ben ⁹), was a general appellation for all
Germans who led an unsettled‚ nearly
nomad life (see Momms. Hist. E. T. iv.
232), as many or perhaps most still did
in Caesar's time (see on c. 26, 2), and
that it did not really denote any distinct
stock. Further confusion would arise
from some being known by the generic‚
others by a specific name.

4. maiorem . . . partem, all beyond
the Elbe and down to the Danube.

5. adhue, probably best taken as
‘further‚' ‘besides’ (cp. c. 10, 3). To
give it the meaning ‘ to this day ' would
imply that specific names gradually
gave way to generic 3 the reverse being
the more probable change.

6. in commune: cp. c. 27, 3, &c.

insigne, ‘ a characteristic ': cp. c. 44,
1, &c. Other general characteristics
are their more restless, predatory habits,
and a general prevalence of monarchy,
also probably some linguistic distinction,
answering to that between High and
Low German.

7. obliquare, ‘to comb back on each
side, and gather in a knot below‚'
apparently to gather the back hair into
a ‘queue' Seneca (de Ira, 3. 26, 3),
makes the ‘crinis rufus et in nodum
coactus' a characteristic of Germans
generally, and Juvenal speaks similarly
(13, 165), and the application of the
ῗῖἱῖἓῧῖῗ. .‘ {³33}ss {Igissssaiss'flffl 42¹3}

. . . . 5,
to ⁴ Suebi’ hardly proves anything. lt
is possible that the custom is not so
distinctive as Tacitus makes it.
