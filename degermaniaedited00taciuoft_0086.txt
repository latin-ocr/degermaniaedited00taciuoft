68 CORNELII TACJTI DE GERMANJA

torum quidem apud illos aut tegularum usus: materia ad
omnia utuntur informi et citra speciem aut delectationem.
quaedam loca diligentius inlinunt terra ita pura ac splendente,

ut picturam ac liniamenta colorum imitetur.

4. lineamenta B C, liniamenta b c.

1. materia, ‘timber'; so in A. 1.
35, 1 (where see note); Caes. 4, 17, 8,
&c. ‘ Zimmer’ (old German ‘ Zimbar ’)
means both ‘chamber' and ‘timber.’
Or. and others cite Herodian's account
of German loghouse villages at the time
of Maximin. The beehive shaped,
thatched, windowless huts of the Mar-
comani and Quadi, represented on the
Antonine column <Bartoli, pl. 9, 65,
δία), though evidently conventional,
may correspond somewhat to the rudest
actual type, such as the huts of serfs.

2. informi, uncouthly fashioned.

eit-ra, ‘falling short of.’ The word
is here equivalent to ‘sine' (cp. ‘ eitra
Romanum sanguinem bellanti ’ Agr. 35,
2), and has often a similar force in silver
Latin. See Peterson on Dial. 27, 2.

delectationem, ⁵ comfort?

3. quaedam loca, &c. This state-
ment is very obscure, and would appear
as if Tacitus was describing something
which he imperfectly understood. It is
not clear whether the colouring was on
the exterior or interior surfaees, but it is
most probable that the ⁶ quaedam loca '
were certain portions or chambers in-
side, and that these were plastered over
with coloured earth or earths of such
purity and brightness as to correspond
in some sort to the Roman wall
decorations (such as are seen at Pompeii).
The ‘earth' can hardly be (as some
think) mere white chalk, which could
hardly be said ‘ imitari picturam,' but is
probably some kind of ochre, and of
more than one colour, so arranged as to
approach in some sort to a design.
‘Imitari' has the sense of substitution,
as in Verg. G. 3, 380; Aen. 11, 894,
&c., and ⁴ picturam ³ is not ‘ a picture'
(in which sense ‘ picturas ’ would
probably have been used) but ‘the art

of painting‚' and is explained by ‘ lini-
amenta colorum ’ (κζ liniamenta colo-
rata'). The whole may be translated
‘some parts they plaster carefully with
earth of such purity and brilliancy of
hue as to form a substitute for paint-
ing and designs in colour.' None of
the emendations proposed (as ‘ poli—
turam ' for ‘picturam‚‘ ‘ locorum,’ ‘ cor-
porum,' &c. for ‘ colorum ’) appear to
be necessary.

4. solent, probably not with the same
subject as ‘inlinunt,' but rather ‘there
are some who ' &c., like ‘ gerunt ⁷ (c, 17,
2). The ruder tribes of the north appear
to be meant.

5. specus. Pliny (19. I, 2, 9) speaks
of such not as dwellings but spinning
places (‘in Germania defossi atque sub
terra id opus agunt ’), and old laws give
evidence of such workplaces sor women
still existing in the middle ages (see Mf.
cited by SS.), as well as storehouses.
Subterranean dwellings for shelter in
winter are described among other
northern nations (cp. Verg. G. 3, 376),
similar to the pit dwellings of which
remains are found in England and else-
where, or to those of the present
Eskimaux.· .

insuper, either ‘overhead ⁹ (c. 12, Ι),
or ⁶ besides’ (c. 31, 3; 45. Ι).

6. hiemis, so most recent edd. (cp.
c. 46, 43 A. 4. 66, 3). The MS. text
‘hiemi ' might possibly be taken (with
Κ.) in the sense of ‘hominibus hieme
vexatis' It is also possible that the
true text is ‘ hieme.'

7. 1001, used not of localities <⁶ loca’)
but distinct spots, in A. 1. 61, 1, &c.,
also in Sall. and Liv.

advenit, best taken as perf. If it
were present, the subjunct. of frequent
action would be used.
