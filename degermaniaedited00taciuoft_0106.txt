(Bavay and Cambray), were the most
powerful of the Belgic Gauls (Caes. 2.
4, 83 15, 3, &c.); all of whom are
spoken of by Caesar (2. 4, 1), as of
German origin. Strabo also makes the
Nervii German (4. 3, 4, 194); but he
has hardly a clear distinction between
the races: see Introd. p. 17, note 8.

cirea, ‘in relation to’; so used
several times by Tacitus, and elsewhere
in silver Latin.

ultro ambitiosi sunt, ‘go so far as
(cp. Agr. 19, 4, Sec) to pride themselves
upon laying claim.’ The use of ‘ adfec-
tationem,' and the contrast ‘ haud dubie '
below, show that Tacitus did not fully
believe in the tradition.

1. tamquam, expressing their view.
Tacitus is himself a despiser of the Gauls
ofhis day (cp. c. 29, 4; Agr. 1 1, 5, &c.)‚
as were the Romans of that time gener-
ally (A. 3. 46, 2, Βία).

similitudine et inertia, hendiadys
for ‘ similitudine inertiae.’

3. haud dubie, taken closely with
‘ Germanorum.'

Vangiones, &c. The chief town of
this peoplewas Borbetomagus (VVorms),
those of the Triboci Breucomagus
(Brumat) and probably Argentoratum
(Strassburgl 3 that of the Nemetes N ovio-
magus (Speyer). The names of the
towns and apparently those of the two
latter people are Celtic, but they all
claimed kinship with Ariovistus and
joined him (Caes. 1. 51, 2). They
formed the chief part of the Roman
‘Germania Superior‚' and served as
auxiliaries (A. 12. 27, 3).

4. Ubii. These in Caesar’s time
(1. 54, 13 4. 3, 3) lived beyond the
Rhine, opposite to the Treveri, but

were taken across by M. Agrippa, with
their own consent, probably in B.C. 38
(see A. 12. 27, 2, and note).
quamquam, with subjunct.‚ as very
often in Tacitus (c. 29, 4; 35, 1 ; 38, 1),
more rarely with indic. as in c. 46, Ι.
5. meruerint (with inf. as in A. 14.
48, 53 Ov. and Quint.), ‘earned' by
their fidelity. Their ‘ oppidum' (A. 1. 36,
Ι, &c.) became ‘Colonia Agrippinae'
(Koln or Cologne) under Claudius in
A.D. 50, taking its name from his wife
Agrippina (A. 12. 27, Ι). Hence the
people drop their German name, and
are called ‘Agrippinenses' (H. 4. 28,
2), a name traced by Grimm (see SS.)
in that of ‘ Grippingenland.'
conditoris sui. The term might
possibly be used of a woman Pramm.
notes c. 7, 4), and ‘sui’ might be an
objective gemit„ like ‘nostri' (A. 11.
24, 6); but it has been thought that,

Tacitus at this time erroneously believed ‚-

Agrippa to have been the founder.

6. erubeseunt, with simple abl., as
in Agr. 42, 3, Liv. &c.

experimento, causal abl„ ‘ by reason
of their tried loyalty.'

7. arcerent, sc. ‘transrhenanos.'

9. Omnium. He has not here men-
tioned the Tungri (see e. 2, 5), nor does
he distinguish from the Batavi the neigh-
bouring Canninefates (H. 4. 15, &c.)
and Cugerni (H. 4. 26, 4, &c.).

Batavi (⁴ Batavi ’ in Lucan, but
‘ Batavi' in Mart., Juv.‚ Sil„ Anth.
Lat), described also with some fulness
in H. 4. 12. They had already before
Caesar’s time (4. 10, Ι) occupied the
island formed by the bifurcation of the
old or true Rhine and the Maas or
Waal (A. 2. 6. 5), where the name sur·
