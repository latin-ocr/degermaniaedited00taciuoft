of was either the temporary elevation
‘to preeminence of one of the ‘ Ealdor-
men’ of a kingless state (see the passages
of Caesar and Bede quoted in Introd.
p. 20j, or the choice of a leader of one
state to command others also in a corn-
bined rising, as in the case of Arminius,
who, though of royal race, was never
king, yet may have commanded kings
of other tribes. We have a ‘ dux Mar-
sorum ’ in A. 2. 25, 2, and the choice of
such a leader, and the inaugurating
ceremony of uplifting him upon a shield,
is described in H. 4. 15, 3.

neo regibus, &c.: so certain kings
are said to rule ‘in quantum Germani
regnantur’ fA. 13. 54, 2): see Introd.
p. 19. The contrast present to Tacitus
was chiefly that of Eastern monarchies
(cp- 0· 37, 3 -

1. aut = ‘ or even ἐ ‘ libera ’ is hardly
as strong a word as ⁴ infinita.'

exemplo, &c. ‘lead by example
rather than command' [instrumental
abl.). The nature of the example is
indicated by ‘si . . . agant ' [subjunct. of
repeated action), and its force on others
by ‘admiratione’ <causan abl.) Cp. ‘sua—
dendi magis quam iubendi potestate'
(c. 1 1. 5).

3. ceterum, restrictive, as in c. 9, 3,
δίε. The expressions rise in strength,
and are all in strong contrast to Roman
custom‚ and perhaps overstated [see
next note).

animadvertere, ‘to put to death'
(so, with ‘in aliquem,' in H. Ι. 46, 83
68, 63 85, 1, δία). 1f Tacitus is right,
Caesar (see note on ξ 1) in expressly
stating that the chosen leader had this
power, must have confounded his func-
tions with those of the priest, of whose
existence and duties he shows no know-
ledge (see note below).

4. ne verberare quidem : this every
Roman centurion could d0.

sacerdotibus, On the German priests,
see Introd. p. 29. Caesar says nothing
on the subject, except (6. 21, 1) to con-
trast the Germans with the Gauls as
having no Druids: a Chattan priest,
named Libes, is mentioned by Strabo
(7. 1. 4, 292) among the captives of
Germanicus.

5. non quasi in poenam, ‘not by
way of punishment'; ‘in' = ‘with a
view to’: cp. ‘in quaestum’ (c. 24, 2),
&c.

nee ducis iussu. Some bring Taci-
tus nearer to Caesar by repeating ‘ quasi,'
but in that case we should expect ‘ aut '
or some other word rather than ‘ nec.'

sed velut, &c., ‘but as if ordered
by the tutelary god.’ The act was one
of sacrifice to the god of the tribe.
Somewhat in a similar spirit we hear
of some or even all of the vanquished
in battle offered as victims to the gods
of the victors; see Introd. p. 30.

6. effigiesque, &c. This seems
closely coupled to the belief of the pres-
ence of the god in battle. Mf. has shown
that the ‘ signa ' are weapons associated
with certain gods (as the lance of Wuo-
dan, the hammer of Donar, the sword
of Tiu, ἃς.) and the ‘ effigies 'those of
animals (cp. H. 4. 22, 4) in some way
consecrated to them (as the serpent and
wolf of Wuodan, the bear and goat of
Donar, the ram of Tiu, the boar of
F reyr, δίο.) Ζ, notes the German skill
in making such figures, and the legends
of Wieland (the German Daedalus),
and the brazen bull of the Cimbri (Plut.
Mar. 23). Some such figures appear in
the sculptures on the Antonine column
(Bartoli, pl. 37).

7. detracta lucis : cp. ‘ depromptae
