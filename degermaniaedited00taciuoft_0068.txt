the Cimbri white (Plut. Mar. 25), and
in later times, the Frisii brown, and the
Saxons red shields. German shields as
represented on the Antonine column
have usually some omamental design
of lines and curves.

1. paucis loricae. In A. 2. 14, 4,
they are rhetorically described as wholly
without cuirasses or helmets. SS2. notes
that the words ‘ Panzer ' and ‘Hamisch ⁷
are of foreign origin. The Cimbrian
horsemen appear to have had more
complete armour (Plut. Mar. 25).

uni alterive‚‘ one or two ’ (very few) :
cp. Dial. 21, 1; Agr. 15, 5, &c.

cassis aut galea; where these terms
are distinguished, the former would
denote a helmet of metal, the latter one
of hide (κυνέη). The German ‘Helm '
denotes merely a cover or protection
(‘hehlen'). On the Antonine column
the German warriors are bareheaded
and have no protection but their shields.
In a few cases a ⁵ pileus ’ is seen.

2. equi, &c. Caesar rehorsed his
German auxiliaries, ‘ quod minus idoneis
equis utebantur ' (7. 65, 5); but speaks
of the skill shown in dismounting and
fighting (4. 2, 33 12. 2). The Tencteri
are exceptionally noted as good horse-
men Qc. 32, 2).

3. variare gyros. Roman horses
were thus trained: cp. ‘in gyros ire
coactus equus ' (Ov. A. A. 3, 384) also
Tib. 4, 943 Lucan 6, 87). By ‘variare,’
the describing of manifold circles is
meant, like a figure 8, 01 like Vergil's
description of the ‘ludus Troianus ⁷
(Aen. 5, 584)-

uno flexu dextros. Some have

added ‘ vel 5111151105,’ thinking that the
copyist had skipped to the similar
termination; others alter ⁶ dextros' to
‘versos' or strike it out as a gloss,
thinking that Tacitus may have written
‘ uno flexu‚' in the sense of ‘ by a simple
flank movement’ (whether to right or
left).

4. ita coniuncto, &c., ‘ so keeping
line as they wheel, that no one drops
behind the one next to him.' It has
been thought that ‘orbe' should be
‘ ordine,' or that the MS. ‘cuncto' points
to ‘iuncto'

5. in universum aestimanti: cp.
Agr. 11, 3; ‘vere reputantibus’ (H. 4.
17, 5), &o This Greek so·called dative
absolute is also thus used in expressions
of judgement by Livy (10. 30. 4; 37.
58, 8). Some instances may equally be
explained as concise ablatives absolute.

of the Chatti (c. 30, 3), also of the
Britons (Agr. 12, 1).

mixti proeliantur. The subject is
not ‘ equites,’ but general.

8. definitur et numerus, &c. It is

⁷ not possible here to enter fully into the

many opinions about this passage; but
it seems plain that he is here speaking
only of the select corps who fought
‘ ante aciem ' (the ‘ acies ' itself, or mass
of warriors, being mentioned below).
He has said that they are generally
stronger in foot than in horse, and adds
that they therefore adopt a mixed order
in battle, supporting the cavalry in
