German tribes, as in c. 1, 1, 30, 2, &c.,

expression from the gladiatorial arena,
especially frequent in Suet.

praeiudicio, ‘ an anticipatory judge-
ment‚’ by the gods who were coneeived
as presiding both over the duel and the
coming battle.

6. minoribus . . . maioribus. On
the latter, see Introd. p. 23. Z. thinks
that the ‘ minores res,' which the ‘prin—
cipes ' could decide alone, included such
matters as land transfer and manumis-
sion: but these seem rather to belong
to local assemblies.

principes: see on c. 5, 4; 10, 4. It
is best to suppose that the local magis—
trates (see c. 12, 3) collectively are here
meant, and that the same are spoken of
in cc. 13, 14 (where see notes). On their
functions generally, see Introd. p. 21.
The body here described, is that of
a senate or βουλή, before which measures
to be submitted to the popular vote are
previously discussed (see Introd. 1.1. and
pp. 18, 23). In later times the witange-

of freemen -K‘ingenuiss c. 25, 3; 44, 4),
and also probably all ‘ nobiles ' who are
not ⁶ principes,’ who eompose the ‘ con-
cilium’ (ep. c. 12, 1; H. 4. 64, 1), an-
sweringto the ἀγορή, ἐκκλησία, or comitia
(see Introd. pp. 18, 23). The old Ger-
man term for a gathering is ‘ thing’ or
‘ding,' and the Anglo-Saxon ⁶ mot'
(Engl. ‘meet,q ‘meeting’). On those
of the Gauls, see Caes. 6. 20.

8. praetractentur (‘a1·e discussed be-
forehand') 3 so Halm, Mn, Pramm.
This verb would be ἄπ. εἷρ; the ana-
logous ·’ praeiuvisse' in H. 3. 65, 2, is
generally rejected; and the alternative
⁶ pertractentur ' has here better MS. au-
thority. On the other hand, Tacitus
elsewhere coins compounds of ‘prae’
(see Drager, Synt. und Stil ξ 249), and
the meaning given here is very apposite
to the context.

9. certis diebus. It is thought that
there is here some confusion between
the greater, or general, and the lesser,
or more local couneils. and that it must
have been the latter that met thus fre-
quently; the former, unless specially
summoned §nisi quid] &e ‘‚ being prob-
ably not gathered ostcner than two or

these also, whenever they met, chose
