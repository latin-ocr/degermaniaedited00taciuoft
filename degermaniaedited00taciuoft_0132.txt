6. Lygios B C e ligios b.
most MSS. text c and two others.

1. lenocinantur, ‘ add to the effect
of' ; so in Dial. 6, 5 (⁴ lenocinatur vo-
luptati'ss, and in Plin. mi. and Quint.

nigra, sc. ‘ sunt?

tincta, ‘ painted.'

atras . . . legunt: cp. ‘electa nox
atra’ (H. 5. 22, 1).

2. ipsa formidine atque umbra,
‘by the mere (cp. c. 13, 4) terrific and
shadowy appearance' (apart from their
fighting qualitiesj.

feralis exercitus terrorem, ‘the
dread of an army of spectres.' This is
clearly the meaning conveyed by ‘ in—
fernum’ below, and it seems best so to
take it here3 but Wolfflin considers
that a new and distinctly stronger figure
is introduced by ί161111,7 and that ‘fe-
ralis exercitus ' should mean ‘ an army
like a funeral procession' : cp. ‘feralem
introitum' [H. 1. 37, 5). The other
meaning seems, however, to be sup-
ported by ‘ feralibus . . . tenebris’ (‘ the
darkness ofdeath ³) in A. 2. 31, 2. The
meaning ‘deadly' or ‘deathbringing'
(as in ⁶ bellum . . . ferale’ H. 5. 25, 5)
does not seem to suit the imagery here.

3. nullo hostium,the frequent Taci-
tean and poetical quasi-partitive geni-
tive, without any partitive idea. Cic.
would have said ‘nullo hoste.’

4. velut infernum, ‘ as it were
hellish.’ The expression at least is
strongcr than ‘ feralis,’ if the meaning
conveyed is the same.

6. Gotones, the Gothi of later his-
tory. They are mentioned by Pliny
(9. 14, 28, 99) as a branch of the Van—
dili, and appear to have been among

Gothones all, text Med. 1 in A. 2. 62.

regnant
8. Lemouii bl H M S, text B C c.

the subjects of Maroboduus (A. 2. 62,
2). Various authorities appear to agree
in making them live at this time on the
right bank of the lower Vistula, ex-
tending to the Fregel, probably the
river Guthalus of Pliny. At the begin·
ning of the third century they were on
the Black Sea.

regnantur (cp. c. 25, 3): the fol-
lowing words show that this reading is
right. Here the expression is concise
(they live beyond the Lugii, and are
ruled by kings).

iarn, probably best taken in a tem-
poral sense (cp. ‘nondum’), implying -
that the power of their kings was getting
on: but cp. ‘nullis iam’ (ξ 3), and
c. 45, 2· ,46 6.

adductius, ‘more strictly ' s a meta-
phor from a tightened rein): cp. ‘adduc-
tius. ,imperitabat' (H. 3. ,>2 ,.&c

7.sup1a libertatem, ‘so las to over-
power freedomj as in Oriental des
potisms.

8. protinus ab,‘ immediately bor-
dering on' *in contrast to ‘ipso in
Oceano’ below). These people pro-
bably lived in Pomerania, between the

,Oder and Vistula. The name of the

former is preserved further west in the
island of Riigen, and they were among
the later enemies of Rome. T he Le-
movii are unknown, and their name has
been taken to mean ‘ a branch,' and to
be perhaps a collectiv e name.

9. insigne: cp. c. 38, 2.

rotunda: on the shapes of German
shields, see on c. 6,
