12. id genti om. C.

1. raro C.

paign ’ ε the same contrast is expressed
in H. 2. 40, 1.

1. excursus, ‘sudden dashes’ (cp.
‘ subitis excursibus,' Agr. 20, 2) : ⁸ rara
est ’ is again supplied with ‘ pugna.’

2. sane, i. e. no wonder this is so
with an army of infantry; ‘ horsemen
soon win a victory, soon give way;
fleetness approaches (so ‘ iuxta ³ answers
to ‘ propior’ in A. 6. 42, 3) timidity,
deliberateness (so in H. 3. 20, 1 ; here
of the movements of foot soldiers) is
ncarer to steadiness! For ‘parare,'
Heraeus and Halm read ‘ parere ’ (refer-
ring to c. 42, 1), but cp. c. 24, 2 ; Dial.
36, 4, &c. Eussner would insert
‘ ceteris ² before ‘ velocitas.’

5. Et, aliis. Here ⁶ et ' is taken with
‘usurpatum' in the sense of ‘id quod
aliis etiam . . . usurpatum, sed rar0.’
Some omit it or alter it to ‘in.'

populis, dative, as in c. 16, 1, &c.

usurpatum raro, ‘what is a rare
practice’ (in appOS. with the infinitive
subjects ‘submittere,’ ‘exuere’). For
this use of the participle as subject
with the force of a relative sentence,
cp. ‘observatum‘ (H. 1. 18, 2), ‘ usi-
tatum ' (Agr. 1, 1), &c.

6. audentia, causal abl. (‘ as a rc-
sult of individual daring') with ‘usur-
patum.' The word is used in c. 34, 33
A. 15. 53, 3, and a few other places in
silver Latin for ‘ audacia,' but in a good
sense only. The point ofthe ‘audentia'
lies in ‘ nec . . . exuere.’ '

in consensum vertit, ‘ has become
universal’; Z. compares ‘in consue-
tudinem vertantur’ (H. 4. 65, 4).

7. submittere, ‘ to let grow wild'3
so in Sen., Plin. Ep„ Suet.‚ for the
more classical ‘crinem promittere.’
Germans usually wore their hair long,
but not wholly unshorn, and kept it
in some order (cp. c. 38, 2‘1, as con-
trasted with the ‘ squalor ' here.

8. votivum. Civilis discharges him-
self of such a vow (H. 4. 61, Ι), and
similar instances are given of later
Saxons and of the Norseman Harold
Harfagr (SS.). Suet. records a similar
vow taken by Julius Caesar (Suet. Jul.
67) after a disaster.

obligatum virtuti, ‘ dedicated (i. e.
by which they had dedicated them-
selves) to valour.'

9. super sanguinem* et spolia,
rhetorical, ‘as they stand over the slain
and despoiled enemy.’

tum demum, &c., ‘not till then
have they repaid their country and
parents for having rearcd them up ¹:
from the Greek phrases θρέπτρα (or
τροφεΐα) ἀποδοῦναι.

11. ignavis et imbellibus, cp. c.
12, 1. The sentence goes with the
preceding, and Tacitus seems not to
have noticed its inconsistcncy with what
follows.

12. insuper, besides the vow of the
hair. Mf. notes that the iron ring was
probably worn on the arm (as an insolvent
