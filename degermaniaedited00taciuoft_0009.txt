PREFACE

—44-

THIS edition, originally undertaken with a view to the
requirements of the higher forms of schools‚ has been
considerably enlarged in the course of preparation,
and now appears on a scale uniform with that of my
edition of the AnnalS. It even exceeds it in the
proportion of commentary to text, and represents
a corresponding amount of time and work; but it still
needs to be prefaced by an apology for the incom-
pleteness which thorough students will easily detect
in it.

It has been evident to me during my work upon
it that the preparation of a really comprehensive
edition would require such a knowledge of German
archaeology‚ history, and law, as probably not many
Englishmen possess, and which few who have acquired
it would care to bring to bear on so limited an object.
A full study would also have to be added of 311 the
minor works and monographs on various points which
the national interest in the subject has accumulated
and still continues to accumulate in Germany; and
an editor who desired duly to gather up and review
the results of such research, would have to make
his commentary so apparently disproportionate to the
bulk of the treatise itself as to repe] the majority
of studentS.
