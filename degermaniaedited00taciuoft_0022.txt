characteristic corresponding gerundive genitive¹ is wholly absent, as
is also the use of a participle in the ablative absolute as predicate,
with a sentence as subject‘2: also the instances of condensation by
zeugma are comparatively few 3, whereas in the Annals they are more
numerous than in any other prose author.

On the other hand, there are many ways in which his rhetorical
exuberance is less subdued than when his historical style had become
more ripe ; and the emphasis which in his later writings would rather
be studied by skilful arrangement of words is here often given by the
sort of expansion used by an orator to drive home his point to his
listeners. Thus what is called ‘anaphora,’ or the repetition for
emphasis of an adjective, pronoun, adverb, &c., is especially fre-
quent4: frequent also is a general redundancy of expression, some-
times in the form of pleonasm, as ‘initium incohatur ' (c. 3ο, 1), much
oftener by combination of nearly if not quite synonymous expres-
5101155, as ‘recens et nuper additum' (c. 2, 5), ‘propriam et sinceram
et sui similem’ (c. 4, 1), ‘laboris atque operum' (c. 4, 3), ‘lucos ac
nemora' (c. 9, 3), ‘temere ac fortuito’ (c. 10, 1), ‘constituunt . . .
condicunt' (c. 11, 2), ‘ignavos et inbelles' (c. 12, 1), ‘infame . . .
probrosum' (c. 14, 2), ‘defendere, tueri' (do), ‘pace et otio' (c. 14.
3), ‘pigrum et iners' (c. 14, 5), ‘discreti ac diversi' (c. 16, 2), ‘ex—
tremo ac novissimo' (c. 24, 3), ‘dolorem et tristitiam' (c. 27, 2),
‘sede finibusque . . . mente animoque’ (c. 29, 3), ‘raptibus aut
latrociniis’ (c. 35, 3), ‘subiecta atque parentia' (c. 39, 4), ‘pax et
quies' (c. 40, 4), ‘arma castraque. . . domos villasque' (c. 41, 2),
‘vis et potentia' (c. 42, 2), ‘rude . . . informe' (c. 45, 5). Some-
times rhetorical point is given by alliteration‚ as ‘mutuo metu aut
montibus' (c. 1, 1), ‘terrent trepidantve’ (c. 3, 1), ‘sudore . . . san-
guine' (c. 14, 5), ‘pace . . . proelio' (c. 18, 3), ‘lamenta et lacrimas*
(c. 27, 2), ‘sanguinem et spolia' (c. 31, 2), ‘virtutis et virium’ (c. 35,
4), ‘proeliis ac periclitando’ (c. 40, 1): sometimes a more poetical
turn is sought by hendiadys, as ‘monumenta et tumulos' (c. 3, 3),
