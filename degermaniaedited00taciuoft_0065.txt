1. frugiferarum arborum, i. e. such
fruit trees as southern climates have:
cp. c. 26, 2. This is consistent with
the mention os ‘ agrestia poma ' in c. 23,
13 and the ‘ frugifera arbor' of c. 10, 1
has a different meaning. The vine is of
later introduction.

inpatiens; so ‘solum .
frugum' (Agr. 12, 5), &e.

pecorum, distinguished from ‘ar-
menta' (c. 21, 1; A. 13. 55, 3) and
‘equi' Κ(ἰ. 12, 2), and probably here to
be understood of sheep, goats, and
swine, but taken by some in a wide
sense of flocks and herds generally.
Pliny says (17. 4. 3, 261, ‘Quid lauda-
tius Germaniae pabulis' 3

2. improcera, sc. ‘sunt': the change
of subject is awkward, but it seems
impossible to call the land itself ‘im-
procera,' and none of the analogies
cited are apposite. Lips. would read
‘ pleraque.' The word seems elsewhere
only used by Gell. (4. 19, 1), of stunted
human bodies.

armentis, ‘cattle.' In A. 4. 72, 3,
the ‘ modica domi armenta ' of Germans
are contrasted with the huge buffaloes
(chiefly known by exaggerated report}
of their forests. Caesar speaks (4. 2, 2)
of their ‘iumenta' (perhaps draught
cattle) as ‘prava atque deformia,' but
trained to hard work.

suus honor, ‘their natural beauty,'
such as Vergil describes (G. 3, 51) in
well-bred cattle.

3. gloria frontis‚poetical: they had
not the branching homs of Italian oxen.

numero gaudent, ‘ the number (not
the quality) of their herd is their pride
(so “gaudent,'' c. 15, 3; 21, 33 46, 2,
&c.); these are their sole and most
cherished wealth.’ ‘ Solae ' seems rather
overstated, but their land was hardly

. patiens

their own (c. 26, 2j, and their house—
hold goods were few. Caesar speaks
of them (6. 35, 6) as ‘pecoris . .
cupidissimi'3 the same words are cited
by SS2. as denoting ln the old G erman
language wealth and cattle (cp. also
‘pecunia ’‘and pecus ’), and the latter
are an established medium of exchange
(c. 12, 2; 18, 13 21, 1, &ej as with the
Homeric Greeks.

4. propitiine an irati, ‘whether it
be in mercy or in wrath that the gods
have denied them,' ὅξος cp. the senti-
ment ‘effodiuntur opes, irritamenta
malorum' (Ov. M. 1, 140); ‘aurum
irrepertum et sic melius situm cum
terra celat' (Hor. Od. 3. 3, 49).

5. nec . . . adfirmaverim nullam,
stronger than ‘ negaverim ullam.' XVhen
writing the Annals. Tacitus knew of
silver mines, but of small value, in the
Taunus district k11- 20, 4). The Rhine
gold is not heard of till the fifth cen-
tury. It is shown below that the pre-
cious metals were at this time known to
Germans, and their names, having no
connexion with Latin, would show that
they were not originally procured
through Roman intercourse.

7. haud perinde, ‘not as much as
might be expected’· . the expression is
so used with an implied comparison in
Agr. 10, 6; A. 2. 88, 4, &c. The con-
text shows that Tacitus is here saying
that the possession and use of preeious
metals as such was little valued, which
is consistent with the fact that they
were eoveted by some as means of
traffic (see also c. 15, 3, and note).
Some wrongly distinguish between the
‘possessio' and ‘usus‚' others take
‘haud perinde ’ as z ‘varie,' meaning that
some did value them and others did not.
