advance of the line by a picked body of
foot able to keep up with them. It is
not clear whether the ‘numerus ' is that
of the cavalry and picked infantry
together, or of the latter only. Caesar's
description of such an e'lz‘le body in the
force of Ariovistus [1. 48, 5) would go
to show that there were an equal number
of each, which would suggest that each
‘pagus’ (on these see c. 12, 3; 39, 4;
Introd. p. 23) furnished fifty of each.
We gather that they were called by a
German name meaning 'the hundred
men,’ and that the word, from being
merely one of number, became a title
of honour. W‘hether we have here any
error arising from the Geiman division
into ‘hundreds' >sssee not'es, 1.1.) is
doubtful.

2. per cuneos, ‘in wedge-like co-
lumns.' SS2. cites authorities to show
that this formation, likened in shape to
a boar's head, is spoken of in the laws
of Manu, and thus shown to be of great
antiquity. The composition of each
separate ‘ cuneus ' is described in c. 7, 33
and these again are combined into one
or more of the whole people. Such
‘ cunei' of distinct tribes are mentioned
in H. 4. 16, 3; 5. 18, 1, δίο. Elsewhere
‘cuneus' is often used of any kind of
formation in phalanx or column.

3. loeo, ‘from your position'; so
‘loco pelli‘ [H. 4. 58, 2), &c.: to a
Roman this was disgraceful. This
German tactic is mentioned in A. 1. 56,
6, and contemptuously spoken of by
Germanicus in A. 2. 14, 5.

dummodo ι except here and in Dial.
25, 2, Tacitus uses in this sense simply
‘dum ’ (H. 1. 46, 4; A. ι. 9, 4, δια).

instes, ‘you press forward '; the sub-
jectis general, as with ‘tueare ' sc. ¹4, 3).

consilii quam formidinis, ⁶ a mark
of prudence rather than of cowardice.’
Such a genitive, like ⁶ morum' ζ A. 1.
30, 2), ⁵ flagitii' (A. 3. 20, 2), &c., may
be explained as qualitative or as quasi-
partitive. The omission of ‘ magis’ or
⁶ potius ’ in comparative sentences is
very common in Tacitus: cp. ⁶ pacem
quam bellum ’ (A. 1. 58, 2 , &e.

4. dubiis, ‘ where they are not vic-
torious ' : it would be only in utter
defeat that the dead are left on the field.

5. praecipuum, ⁶ the greatest': this
term has often in silver Latin the force
ofa superlative (c, 7, 33 14, 2 ; δία).

6. concilium. On these meetings,
see c. 11-12.

be distinguished from the penalty of
death for confirmed cowardice described
in c. 12, 1.

7. superstites ; so with genit. in Agr.
3, 2, &c., also with dat. in c. 14, 2, &c

8. Reges, &c., ‘they choose kings by
ancestry, generals by merit' (C. B> ε ‘ex'
:- ‘in accordance with,' as in c. 3, 4; 9, 3,
&c. The royal races generally traced
their pedigree to a god, as Wuodan [see
on c. 2, 3), and the old German term
‘chuninc ' (Anglo-Saxon ‘ cyning,' later
·' Ko'nig’) seems best explained as con-
nected with a root denoting lineage (sce
the vicws given in Bp.st11}‡bs,i. 1 58). On
the position and power of the king gene-
rally, see Introd. p. 19, and authorities
there cited. It is not clear whether
even he was subject to the ‘ dux ’ in war,
or whether, as most think, where he
existed, he was also the natural leader.
and such choice of a ‘dux’ (⁴ herizoho,’
‘ herzog‚' or · duke ’) as is here spoken
