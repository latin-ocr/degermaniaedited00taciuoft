authority in peace than that of the ‘ concilium? There is full evidence
that at an earlier as well as at a much later date many tribes were
thus governed1‚ and that the subsequent prevalence of kingly rule is
not due so much to a sentiment deeply implanted in the German
mind ‘-' as to other causes, partly to the prominence of tribes belonging
of old to the Suebic or monarchical stems 3, partly to the consolidation
of separate tribes, and to the courses of movement and conquest which
tended to make a stronger central rule more needful⁴, and led not only
to kingly government but to a very different type of it from that here
described, as military and victorious kings were able to gather more
into their hands, to surround themselves with a constantly increasing
‘comitatus’ (see below, p. 25), and to become more and more lords
of the soil instead of being only leaders of the people.

As regards the other ranks of German society, we find much of
what is more fully known to us at a later date already in existence.
We have the distinction between the mass of freemen (‘ ingenui ’) and
the ‘nobiles ⁵,'’ answering to the English ‘ ceorl' and ‘eorl,' or to the
yeoman and the knight or esquire ὃ. Both classes in some sense and
degree are landowners, and have the right of voting in assemb1y⁷.
The ground of nobility is not indicated, but can hardly have been
any other than that of supposed descent from divine or heroic
ancestors. It is, however, thought that nobility, though a sine qua

¹ Caesar says of the Germans gene—
rally (6. 23, 4), ⁶ cum bellum civitas
aut inlatum defendit aut infert, magis—
tratus, qui ei bello praesint, ut vitae
necisque habeant potestatem, deligun-
tur. In pace nullus est communis
magistratus, sed principes regionum
atque pagorum inter suos ius dicunt.'
He however gives the title ‘rex Ger-
manorum' to Ariovistus (1. 31, 10),
whose position, as a leader of many
nations, must have resembled that of
Maroboduus. So also Hengist and
Horsa, and the leaders of the first con-
quest of XVessex, have no other titles
than those of ‘Ealdorman’ or ‘Heres
toga’; and Bede's account of the Saxons
(H. E. v. 10) is in accordance with
Caesar: ‘non enim habent regem . . .
sed satrapas plurimos suae genti prae-
positos, qui ingruente belli articulo
mittunt aequaliter sorteS, et quemcun-
que sors ostenderit, hunc tempore belli
(lucem omnes sequuntur . . . peracto

autem bello rursum aequalis potentiae
omnes fiunt satrapae.’ The ‘ satrapae '
are the ‘ principes.’

Britain, though not at first governed by
kings, soon became so.

⁵ These are clearly distinguished in
c. 25, 33 44, 4. The ‘plebs' ofe.11, Ι;
12, 3, would appear to include both
these classes, as distinct from ‘ prin-
cipes.' The ‘ proceres’ distinguished
from ‘plebs' in c. 10, 5, appear more
equivalent to ‘nobiles ⁷ (cp. c. 46, 1 ‘, but
the term is interchanged with ‘prin-
cipes' in A. Ι. 55, 3. ‘Primores’ (used
only in Hist. and Arm.) mean prob-
ably ‘principes'
