THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BV TACJTUS 15

which any approach is made to so complete an enumeration of tribes,
or to so systematic a mapping out of their territory; and in many
cases the locality assigned to a people is confirmed by other autho-
rities, sometimes even by modern local survivals of the name¹ ; so
that there is no reason on the whole to doubt that the distribution
of the country given by him was at the time substantially correct, so
far as correctness was possible in a race among whom the prevalent
internecine feuds might at times bring a hitherto unknown tribe
into prominence, or reduce a once famous name to insignificance
or even extinction 2, relegate a frontier nation to the forest recesses
of the interior, break up a large people into subdivisions with specific
names ³, or otherwise alter the distribution of territory in ways not
afterwards traceable. It is thus perhaps hardly matter for surprise
that among the comparatively few names given by his predecesmrs,
he omits some that had once been famous 4, or that afterwards
became so ⁵, and that his list of names and arrangement differs much
from that given some fifty years later by Ptolemy f'.

The whole vast territory is conceived by him as occupied by a dis-
tinct and homogeneous race, whom he supposes to be autochthonous‚
and free from intermixture of foreign blood⁷‚ consisting of rather
more than forty distinct‘ nationes' or ‘populi’ · ‚some at least of
whom were grouped of old under a few generic names of ancient
tradition⁹; the whole ra'ce haring become known by the one common

² We have thus an account of the

decay of the Cherusci ( c. 36} and tem-
porary extinction of the Bructeri (c. 33,
Ι, and note), also elsewhere of the
wanderings and annihilation of the
Ampsivarii (A. 13. 54-56).

³ Thus the Marsi, a specific people
in the time of Germanicus, appear to
have broken up at the date of this
treatise, and are only mentioned as an
ancient generic name c. 2, 4). Itis
noted that the Chatti and Frisii are
perhaps the only tribes which did not
change their habitation

of these in his subsequent record, but
only distinguishes between the Suebi
and those Germans who were not such :
see on c. 38, 1. He also shows that the
Lugii are a generic name vvc. 43, 3¹,

and Sitones are also such gc. 44. 2:
