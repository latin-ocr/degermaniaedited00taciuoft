the name ‘Cherusci'in c. 36, 1); but
it would seem from A. 2. 14, 3, that
they were not a general weapon, as with
Romans. German swords were generally
large, and therefore costly and confined
to the more completely armed. The
Marcomani and Quadi in the sculptures
on the Antonine column (see Bartoli's
plates) are sometimes represented with
short swords.

maioribus lanceis. The ‘ enormes ²
or ‘ingentes hastae' of Germans are
often mentioned (A. 1. 64, 3; 2. 14, 3,
21, 13 H. 5. 18, 1; Lucan, 6, 256) as
very formidable except at close quarters,
and not as if they were as rare as is here
stated; but Germanicus is made to say
(ΝΑ. 2. 14, 4) that only the front rank
had ‘ hastae,' the rest ‘ praeusta aut
brevia tela.’ -

Ι. frameas. These, which are here
called ‘ hastae‚' in contrast to the
‘ maiores lanceae,' seem to be the ‘ brevia
tela ' contrasted with ‘ hastae ⁷ in A. l.l.
Many heads of such, both of iron and
bronze, have been found in tombs, The
German word (derived by Mf. from
⁶ sram,’ ‘ forwards,' as denoting its mode
of use) is used by Tacitus in this treatise
only. It is used without reference to
Germans in Juv. 13, 79, and given in
a list of weapons in Gell. 10, 25.
Augustine and Isidorus take it to mean
a sword, but it still survives as a word
for a missile spear in Spanish (SS).
Vergil’s Gallie ‘ gaesum ’ (Aen. 8, 662),

perhaps also his Teutonic ‘ cateia ' =,·Aen. .

7, 741), seem to be similar weapons.
Spears answering to the description of
the ‘framea' are represented on the
Antonine column: see Bartoli, pl. 363

4 scuto. Their shields are described
in A. 2. 14, 4, as very large, but of
wicker or thin coloured boards, not
strengthened by iron or leather. Round

shields are noted as exceptional in c. 44,
1, but in the sculptures on the Antonine
column the prevalent form is such or
oval, much resembling the ‘clipeus’
assigned frequently to Roman soldiers.
Sometimes the form is given as an
elongated octagon. and SS. speaks of
trapezoid and triangular German shields.

missilia, such as the ‘saxa glan-
desque’ of H. 5. 17, 5. Some slingers
and archers are represented on the
Antonine column xpl. 11, 27).

po)etry (Vei-g. Aen. 7, 6863 8, 695; 12,

nudi. The contrast ‘sagulo leves'
shows that this is to be taken literally
or nearly so (cp. c. 20, 1; 24, 1 ; H. 2.
22, 2). On the German dress generally.
see c. 17, 1, and note. Some appa-
rently German auxili-aries represented
on the column of Trajan (Baltoli, pl.
26> have ‘ braccae‚’ but above the waist
are either altogether bare or have a
‘ sagum ' only, and this is probably what
is here meant. Vergil (9. 1, 229) usus
‘nudus’ rhetorically of a labourer clad
only in the tunic, as does Pliny (N.
H. 18. 3, 4, 20) of Cincinnatus at the
plough.

6. leves, ‘lightly clad'3 so of one
lightly armed, in Verg. Aen. 9, 548.
On the German ‘ sagum ' see c. 17, 1.

eureus. The context would show
this to be taken of adornmcnt of arms
or military decorations, such as were
displayed by Romans (cp. ll. 1. 88, 4;
A. 1. 24, 4, διο.) or Gauls (LiV. 7. 10,
7; Verg. Aen. 8, 660, &c.).

lectissimis coloribus: cp. ⁴ fucatas

tribes seem to have had their own
colours, as the Harii black (c. 43, 6),
