dean.' Cicero so speaks of antipodes sented to any one but a native. With

in Somn. Scip. ὁ ((1105 qui incolunt
terram . . . partim etiam adversos stare
nobis⁷), and Pliny speaks of the south
pole as ‘adversus' (2. 68, 172), and of
flight of birds ‘ex adverso orbe’ (10.
6, 7, 19). It is, however, doubtful
whether Tacitus so understood the form
of the earth (see note on c. 45, 1), and
the alternative interpretation ‘hostile’
is supported by the figure used in c. 34,
3, but would make the expression hardly
strong enough to require ‘ ut sic dixerim.'
Some oid edd. read ‘aversus,’ after
Acidalius.

1. orbe nostro, used of the Roman
world in Agr. 12, 3, &c.,here especially
of the Mediterranean nations.

praeter, ‘not to mention'3

‚ 2.

442. Asia . . . Africa, not used here in
the narrow provincial sense, but of such
parts of these continents as bordered on
the Mediterranean.

3. peteret, potential, referring to
past time = ‘ quem olim petisse putas? ⁵

informem terris, &c.,‘ wild in scenery
(abl. of respect), rigorous in climate,
repulsive to inhabit and behold': ‘in-
formis’ is mostly used by Tacitus of
rough material (c. 16, 3; 45, 5, δία),
so here of soil little cultivated. ‘ Cultu'
is best taken as a supine, and the sense
here given (cp. c. 16, 1; 28, 43 32, 1,
Sec.) seems more suitable than that *of
‘to cultivate? Seneca speaks similarly
<de Prov. 4, 14) of the ‘ perpetua hiems‚'
‘triste caelum,' ‘sterile solum‘ of Ger-
many.

4. nisi si patria sit, ‘ unless he were
born in it.’ The incongruity of this
sentence with ‘ peteret' and the change
of tense to the present, shows that it
should be taken closely with ‘tristem,'
&c., as describing the appearance pre-

so in c.

suggested reading

‘nisi si' the indic. is generally used
(Agr. 32, Ι, &C.)‚ whence some have
‘est’ for ‘sit,' or

‘ cui ' for ‘si.’ Holder reads ‘nisi sibi '

after H.

5. Celebrant,sc.‘Germani’: asecond
proof is drawn from their tradition of
descent from an autochthonous god.

memoriae et annalium, ‘tradition
and history ’ : ‘annales' is used generally
for the latter in A. 2, 88, 43 3. 65, 1,
&c. For these particular songs Tacitus
is our sole authority, but such have

formed the beginnings of history in most

nations, and such were in use among
the Germans of that time not only to
record past traditions, but recent events,
such as the exploits of Arminius (A. 2.
88, 4). For what is known of their
character and structure see SS.‚ and the
authorities there cited.

6. Tuistonem. This form, adopted
by Mf. and most recent edd„ can be
explained to mean ‘ gemellus ' (⁶ a being
combined of both sexes'), a meaning
also possible with the form ‘ Tuisconem '
(preferred by Grimm and others), and
expressing an idea found in other ancient
mythologie& Others have supposed the
true form to be ‘Teutonem,' from the
root seen in the name of the people
associated with the Cimbri (see on c. 37,
1) and in other German and Celtic
names. It is very possible that the
legend here given reappears in the wor-
ship of the god mentioned in c. 39, 43
and other mythologies, which, if not
later than Tacitus, are at least unknown
to him (see Introd. p. 29, note 7), point to
Wuodan as the great originator, repre—
senting him as having created a man
and woman out of trees (Rhys, Hibbert
Lectures, 283), and as the god or hero
whose sons are eponymi of various
