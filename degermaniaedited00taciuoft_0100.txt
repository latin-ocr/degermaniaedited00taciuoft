82 CORNELII TACJTJ DE GERMANJA

domus officia uxor ac liberi exsequuntur. verberare servum 2
ac vinculis et opere coercere rarum: occidere solent, non
disciplina et severitate, sed impetu et ira, ut'inimicum, nisi

quod impune est.

ut colono. If this term is to be
taken in the sense in which it is used at
a much later date by jurists, it would be
true that the condition of the ‘ colonus ’
generally resembled that of the serf or
villein, but he had more legal rights
than we can suppose in these German
bondsmen (see Dict. 01 Ant. s. v.; In-
trod. p. 21). If, however, as at this date
is more likely, the term is used in the
older and more popular sense of a ten-
ant farmer bound only by his contract
(cp. Hor. Sat. 2. 2, 115 ; Plin. ad Trai.
8 χ 24), 5, &cyfi there would be very
little analogy between the cases.

haetenus paret, ‘ his obedience ends
here': cp. ‘hactenus iussum' (Agr. 10.
6), and several other passages (eg. A.
12. 42, 5; 14. 3, 2). The subjectionis
much understated: the serf was ‘ ad-
scriptus glebae,' and in legal formulae
the ‘ mancipia ' pass, like buildings, &c.‚
with the estate (Ross‚ p. 127); also if
extra service were demanded, the slave
had no legal remedy, and the power to
scourge and kill is shown below to have
existed. Probably slaves furnished the
human sacrifices described in c. 9, 13
39, 1 ; certainly in c. 40, 5.

cetera domus officia, ‘the rest, the
household duties ² (of the master's
house) : so ‘ ceterum vulgus ⁹ is opposed
to officers in H. 3. 12 ; 4. 56, 2, and simi-
lar uses 01 ‘ alius' and ἄλλος are
found. SS. mentions later instances of
even the king's wife superintending the
cooking.

1. verberare; compare the constant
scourgings of a Roman household (Juv.
6, 475-485‚ &cc->-

2. opere coercere, ‘to punish (cp.
c. 11, 5) by taskwork': cp. ‘accedes
opera agro nona Sabino’ (Hor. Sat. 2.
7, 118). The Roman masters sent re-
fractory household slaves to an ‘ ergas-

tulum ' or ‘ pistrinum ' (Marquardt, Pri-
vatl. 183).

3. disciplina et severitate, hendia-
dys 101 ‘disciplinae severitate' (H. 1.
51, 2), an extreme case of which was
the Roman practice of executing the
whole household when a master was
murdered by any one 01 1113 slaves. Cp.
A. 14. 42-45.

impetu, ‘ impetuouslyj

ut inimicum, ''as they would kill
an enemy.'

4. impune, i. e. if one's own slave.
He who killed the slave of another had
to pay his value as a chattel.

liberti. SS. notes the term (‘ frilaz ')
for a manumitted person :md the forms
for manumission preserved in ancient
German laws. They were still ‘ Hori·
ge' or ‘ Lite’ (Z), and were in a
condition 01 clientship‚ as were also
some ‘ ingenui‘ (see Introd. p. 22).

5. momentum, ‘a weight to turn
the scale': cp. H. 1. 59, 2; 76, 5. It
is better to supply ‘sunt' from above,
than ⁶ habent ' or ‘ faciunt ' (with K).

numquam in civitate, a contrast to
Rome, especially under Claudius, whose
chief freedmen, Pallas and Narcissus,
were the most influential men in the state.

6. dumtaxat, only here in Tacitus.

quae regnantur: such as most 01
the Suebi (see Introd. p. 19). The
passive ‘regnari‚’ ('c. 44, 1 ; H. 1. 16, 1 1,
Sco.) is from poets (Verg, Hor„ &c.).

ibi enim, &c. The king's freed-
men became important by being capable
01 holding important offices, such as in
later times those 01 ‘seneschall' and
‘mareschalL’ So also the imperial
freedmen at Rome held such important
offices as those of secretary and trea-
311101(ί a libellis,' ‘ a rationibus '),which
were then considered beneath the dig-
nity of persons of higher political status.
