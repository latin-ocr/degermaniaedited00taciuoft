Mf. thinks that this idea specially con-
nects this people with the later Juthungi,
whose name he takes to mean ‘offspring'
(i.e. of the god).

regnator omnium deus. From the
fact that the later Schwabians were
entitled ‘ Ziuwari ’ (worshippers of Ziu
or Tin) Grimm infers that the deity
here was not lYodan but Tiu; who
would thus appear in this very primi-
tive worship to have been conceived not
as the mere war god ζ see on e. 9, 1),
but g as the name itself suggests) as
a more general deity, answering to Zeus
or Dyaus. This would make it pro-
bable that we have here the general
worship of the Herminones (c. 2, 3);
that in c. 40. 2 being¹ conjectured to
belong to the Ingaevones.

Ι. adicit auctoritatem, ‘ gives them
further consideration'tamong the Suebi);
i.e. makes them ‘nobilissimi‚' as their
religion shows them to be ‘ vetustissimi ¹
(ξ ῐ).

2. centum pagi iis habitantur ; so
Halm, Mr.‚ SS‘2.: most others read
‘pagis habitant.' It has been noted
that Caesar states this fact of the Suebi
as awhole (see on c. 38, 1). It has
been thought that we have here, as else-
where (c. 6, 5; 12, 3), some confused
trace of the identity of the ‘ pagus ’ with
, the ‘ hundrcd‚' as an aggregate of ‘ vici ’
(see Introd. p. 23).

magno corpore, ‘ by their great
mass': cp. ‘corpus . . . . Germaniae’
(H. 4. 64, 2), ‘ populi corpus' (Liv. 1.
8, Ι), &c.

3. caput, ‘ the leading nation.'

4. Langobardos. This name is
generally taken to mean ‘ the long-
beards,’ but by some as ‘ the long axes.'
They were attacked by Tiberius «Veh.
2. 106, 2), and probably driven across

the Elbe by him, and were afterwards
subject to but revolted from fA. 2. 45, Ι)
Maroboduus (c. 42, 2), and supported
a Romanized king of the Cherusci (A.
11. 17, 5), part of whose territory they
probably afterwards acquired. They
appear at this time to have occupied
a district on both sides of the Elbe, bor-
dered west and south by the Chauci,
Cherusci, and Semnones, and answcring
to parts of Mecklenburg and north-
eastern Hanover, where the name Bar-
danwic (near Liineberg) preserves a
trace of them. The importance of the
name in south Germany dates from the
middle of the fifth century, and their
kingdom in Italy lasted for two cen—
turies from A.D. 568.

paucitas nobilitat, a contrast to
the Semnones, whose ‘magnum corpus'
made them ‘nobilissimi' These owed
their distinction to the fact that, though
few, they had the spirit to hold their
own among more numerous peoples.
They afterwards became very numerous.

5. proeliis et periclitando, allitera-
tive. Veli„ who first mentions them,
calls them ‘ gens Germana feritate fero-
cior.’

6. Reudigni (the form approved by
Mt), nowhere else mentioned, but
thought to have lived near the mouth
of the Elbe, in and round the district or·
Hamburg. Mf. takes the name to be
from a root meaning σεμνός, and sup-
poses thern to have presided over the
worship here mentioned.

deinde, ‘ next in site‘ <on north and
east> : cp. c. 42, 1, &o

Aviones, apparently
whence they are supposed to have lived
in the islands near the mouth os the
Elbe and osf Schleswig. mentioned by
Pliny (see on c. Ι, Ι).
