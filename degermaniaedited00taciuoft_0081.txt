the admission to his ‘ comitatus? Many
have noted the resemblance to mediaeval
knighthood.

1. haec . . . toga (sc. ⁴ virilis'). Taci-
tus is contrasting this public act (cp. ‘in
ipso concilio ’ above) with the Roman
private ceremonies of the ‘ tirocinium,'
which, however, was accompanied by a
ί deductio in forum?

2. honos, ‘gift ofhonour,’ cp. c. 15, 2.

ante hoe, &oz it was in fact an
act of emancipation ‘ e manu patris,' but
probably the full rights of a freeman
were confined to landholders. The Ro-
man ‘toga virilis' gave no emancipation.

3. insignis nobilitas, &c. The
reading and interpretation of this pas·
sage are much disputed. As regards
this sentence, ‘dignitatem’ has good
MS. authority, but ‘dignationem' is
very generally read. The latter word
has always elsewhere in· Tacitus, and
also in most other authors, much the
same force as the former, and denotes
a person's rank or position, or the con-
sideration in which he is held: cp. c.
26, 1; ‘inponere imperatoris digna—
tionem ' (H. 1. 52, 7), &c. The mean-
ing would thus be ‘ distinguished rank
or great services of parents award to
some even as striplings (stronger than
‘iuvenem ' above) the position of a prince ’
(cp. ‘imperium adsignabunt,' H. 1. 30,
7). The difficulty of connecting the
sentence thus interpreted with the fol-
lowing words Q see note below), added
to that ofsupposing that ‘ adolescentuli '
could become ‘ principes⁷ in any such
sense as that given above (ξ 1), has led
others to take ‘principis dignationem ¹
to mean ‘the esteem, or approval of
a prince,' i.e. that on such grounds a
prince sometimes selects even striplings,
whom he himself invests with arms gsee
above), and whom he at once enrols
among his ‘comites’ This sense of
‘ dignatio,’ though otherwise foreign to
Tacitus, seems borne out by such pas·

sages as · tanta dignatione dilexit' {Suet
Cal. 24⁸, ‘ in summa dignatione regis
vixit' (Just. 3. 28, 107, and certainly
makes the whole passage much clearer,
though we should perhaps expect some
other verb than ‘ adsignant,' in the sense
of ·’ bespeak.'

4. ceteris„ &c. With the interpre-
tation preferred above, this would
mean that those whom the ‘princeps'
honours even as striplings with admis-
sion to his ‘comitatus,' are grouped
with the older members of it, and are
not ashamed, in spite of their high pa-
rentage, to serve in its rank and file.
Those who take the other interpretation
of ‘ principis dignationem ' would either
explain these words as meaning that
the ‘ adolescentuli,' though already
ranked as ‘principes,' are not at once
actual leaders, but serve for a time in
the ranks (a meaning hard to get out
of the words), or would (as Halm, Mn,
Pramm. and others) adopt Lipsius'
reading ‘ceteri,’ with the meaning that
those ‘tirones' who were not so ex-
ceptionally ranked as ‘principes,’ ‘are
grouped with riper and tried warriors.’
join themselves to the ‘comitatus' of
some chief. But we should rather sup-
pose that those invested with arms by
the parent or guardian were enrolled in
the ⁶ cuneus’ of the family or elan (c.
7, 3). Several other alterations of the
text have been suggested.

5. neo rubor ε ‘nec rubori,' poet. for
‘ nec dedecus’: cp. ‘nec rubor est emisse'
(Ov. A. A. 3, 167), and Peterson’s note
on Dial. 37, 1. This sentence supports
the reading ‘ ceteris‚' as it would most
naturally refer to persons of high birth.
If ‘ ceteri ' be read, there would be here
no special reference to the ⁶ adolescen—
tuli,’ but a general remark, with an irn-
plied contrast to the position of a client
at Rome, so osten described as humiliat—
ing. The subject of the ‘comitatus'
extends to the end of c. ¹4·
