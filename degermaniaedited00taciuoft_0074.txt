1. peregrinorum C.

pretatio Romana' (c. 43, 4), founded
perhaps on the idea that the symbol of
a ship suggested a comparison with
the ceremony called ‘navigium Isidis'
<March ᾗ), 111 which a ship was launched
and dedicated to Isis in token of re-
commencement of navigation (Apul.
Met. 11. 16, 786, cp. Marqnardt, Staats-
verwaltung, iii. 80). Grimm (E. T. i.
258, 1011), and Ritt. note a procession of
a shiplike car in later times in Flanders
(where a Suebic offshoot is found,
see on Agr. 28, 4), resembling that of
the chariot of Nerthus χ6. 40, 2), 311
identification with whom is also sug-
gested by the general correspondence
of Isis and Terra. Either the ‘ Hludana ’
or the ‘ Nehalennia,' both found in votive
inscriptions in that region, may be the
German name of this Isis. For other
forms of the earth goddess see note on
6. 40, 2.

1. unde causa, 56. ‘ sit.⁷ The omis-
sion of the subjunct. of ‘esse’ is more
frequent in Tacitus than in previous
writers. For similar instances in relative
clauses cp. 6. 13, 3, 19, 3, 816.

German gods above mentioned.

2. nisi quod, ‘except that’:c

’signum ipsum, ζ61611 1116 s3 mbol'

signum' is ambiguous and might denote
theb s3mbol of the goddess or that of
the means of transport.

liburnae, a chiefl3 poetica] 11 01(1 for

‘’liburnica, 11111611 properly denotes a
‘ biremis,' or ship of war smaller than

a trireme, but came to have sometimes
a wider meaning.

signum' just mentioned, and perhaps
to the anthropomorphism suggested b3

He appears to forget the extremely
anth ro pomorphic conception of Hercules

nec cohibere parietibus, &c. The
statement of Tacitus here is perhaps
too sweeping (see 6. 40, 3, 311(1 11016),
but resembles the account given of the ·
Gauls, whose ‘loca consecrata' (Caes.
6. 17, 4) were apparently groves (Lucan
3. 399, foll.). Temples seem, however,
to have been common in Germany at
the advent of Christianity among them.
The statement that th ere were no images
of gods is consistent with c. 7, 3, possibly
also with 6. 40, 5 (see notes), but*
certainly at variance with later Christian
information (see Grimm, p. 106, foll.)‚
though on other grounds credible (see
Introd. p. 29). The Gauls had ‘simu-
lacra’ (Caes. 6. 17, 1), but of rude
character (Lucan 3, 412), though after—
wards more elaborate (Prin. 34, 7, 18,
45>-

adsimulare, ‘to liken':
10, 1, here ‘to 1·epresent.’

5. lucos ac nemora, often thus
coupled as synonyms or nearly such:
cp. 6. 10, 4; 45, 7; Dial. 12, 1, &a
Tacitus mentions a ‘ lucus Baduhennae '
s'A. 4. 73, 7) and ‘silva Herculi sacra'
(A. 2. 12, 1): ep. also 6. 7, 3; 39, 2;
40, 2; 43, 4³ H· 4· 14, 3- Many
references to such groves are found also
in Christian writers3 and it is noted by
Grimm that in old German the same
word, as ‘11a1·uc,' stands for a grove
and, later, for a temple.

6. deorumque nominibus, ‘and
give the names of deities to that

to that used in H. 5. 5, 63 ‘Iudaei
