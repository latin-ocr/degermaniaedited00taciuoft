1. umor Hold. Mr.,

³ tion is due to the desire to make the
contrast as pointed as possible, and
some reasonable qualification may be
readily understood.

1. Potui, se. ‘ est.' This predicativc
dative, expressing that which a thing or
person serves as, or occasions, is com-
mon in Tacitus, most frequently in forms
in ‘ui,’ as ‘victui,’ ‘ vestitui ’ (6. 46, 3),
‘derisui’ (Agr. 39, 2), ‘inrisui' (H. 1.
7, 5),‘ indutui’ (Α. 16. 4, 2),‘ obtentui’
(H 1. 49, 6, &e. )‚‘ ostentui' (A. 15.
64, 2, &c.).

frumento, probably for the specific
16111κ1111160’(1ν116ῖι1);0111111135 been
doubted whether the Germans then had
it. Mead from honey seems to have
been known to all Aryan speaking
peoples (Τ aylor, 170), and intoxicating
drink from grain was known to many
nations and had many names, as ‘zy-
thum’ in Egypt, ‘caelia' and‘ cer’ea
in Spain, cervesia' in Gaul, &o (Plin.
22. 25, 82,164). The old forms ofthe
words‘ beer' and‘ ale⁷ may be native
German, but their claim is questioned.
⁴ Barleywine ’ was the common drink of
the Kelts (Gauls) as late as the time of
Julian, whose epigram upon it is pre-
served (Anth. Pal. ix. 3683 see also
Mommsen, Hist. v. E. T. i. 108).

Τίς πόθεν εἷς Διόνυσε, · μὰ γὰρ τὸν

ἀληθέα Βάκχον,
Οὔ σ’ ἑπιγιγνώσκω· τὸν Διὸς οἰδα
μόνον.

Κεΐνος νέκταρ ὄδωδε, σὺ δὲ τράγου·

ἧ ῥά σε Κελτοι
Τῇ πενίῃ βοτρύων τεῦξαν ἀπ’
ἀσταχύων.

Τῷ σε χρὴ καλέειν Δημήτριον, οὐ

Διόνυσον,
Πυρογένη μᾶλλον καῖ βρόμον, οὐ
Βρόμιον.

2. corruptus, ‘fermented’; the idea
appears to be that of decomposition or
change of nature. K. would take it as
equivalent to ‘in similitudinem vini
corrupti sactus?

et vinum mereantur. This impor-
tation was forbidden in Caesar's time

by the Suebi (4. 2, 6), as also by the
Gallie Nervii (2. 16, 4). SS2. notes the
German words for wine and all con-
nected with winemaking as foreign.

3. cibi, &c. It is shown in the fol-
lowing notes that the account of their
10011 is very defective.

agrestia poma, uncultivated and un-
grafted apples, such as grew in fields
rather than gardens (see note on 6. 5, 1).
Such were part of a simple diet even in
Italy (A. 15. 45, 6). The Germans are
known at that time to have had other
wild fruits, berries, 111115, &c. ; also some
kinds of vegetables, as beans and edible
roots.

reeens fera, game not hung (as at
Rome, to become tender. If hunting
was rare (c. 15, Ι), this food must-have
be'en exceptionaL and they must also
have eaten the flesh of domestic animals,
birds, and fish. The statement of Mela
(3. 3, 28) that they ate raw meat, both
fresh and dried on the skin, is perhaps
true of the latter only3 such dried meat
being even now not unknown in some

arts.
p lac concretum (c1>.Verg. G. 3, 463]‚
‘ curdled milk ’ (‘ dicke Milch ’). Caesar
says of the Suebi (4.1, 8) ‘maximam
partem lacte atque pecore vivunt,' and
of the Germans in general (6. 22, 1)

consistit '; butthe name for cheese (K'ase)
would show it 10 be of foreign origin.
Ncither Caesar nor Tacitus speaks oftlie
oatmeal pulse, mentioned by Pliny {see
on 6. 5, 1) as a chief article of German
food.

4. apparatu: cp. 6. 14, 4; herc used
of sumptuous luxuries, and further ex-
plained by ‘ blandimentis,' ‘provocatix’es
to appetite,’ the ‘irritamenta gulae' of
Sall. Jug. 89, 7, or the ‘ qualia lassum
pervellunt stomachum’ of Hor. Sat. 2.
