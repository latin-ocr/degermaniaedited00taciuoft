ties permitted in either case (see note
above), or that they became more severe
after his time.

1. aetate, ‘youth ἐ the ablatives are
causal.

2. invenerit. The subject can be
supplied from the sense.

3. eorrumpere et corrumpi, so
coupled in A. 14. 20, 5.

saeculum, ‘the spirit of the age‚’
way of the world.

melius, sc. ‘ agunt ⁷: verbs of motion
or action, as well as of speaking, are
often omitted by Tacitus. Cp. Agr.
19, 23 ‘vos quidem istud pro me' tH.
1. 841) ‘melius . . . ille' (A. 1. 43, 1),
διε. ‘Adhuc' adds force to the com-
parative <‘better still ²), as in c. 29, 3,
and has often the sense of ‘further⁷
(ep. e. 10, 3), like ἔτι.

4. in quibus, &c. There is later
evidence that among some the widow
was expected to hang herself, or to burn
on the husband's pile, like the Indian
Suttee‚ and that the marriage of widows,
even where not forbidden, was thought
dishonourable. This is, of course, a
still stronger eontrast to Roman eustom.

5. spe votoque, ‘the hope and as-
piration.' of married life.

semel transigitur, ‘ they have done
with, once sor all' : cp. ‘transigite cum
expeditionibus' (Agr. 34, 4).

sie, answering to ‘ quomodo ' (‘so . . .
as’), as in Agr. 34, 23 Dia'.. 36, 8; A.
4. 35, 3; 16. 31, 2, &c.‚ and in Cic.

6. ne, se. ‘sit ': cp. e. 13, 3, &Q

7. ultra, beyond one marriage.

ne tamquam, δια, ‘that her love

may be, as it were, not for the husband,
but for the married state 'z that she
should love her husband not merely as
a man, but rather as elevating her to
the permanent dignity of a matron.
‘Tamquam' has constantly in Tacitus
the force of ὡς, 11616 rather that of ὡς
εἰπεῖν, as qualifying a strong statement.
Meiser would read ‘tam maritum quam,'
others omit the second ⁶ tamquam.'

8. numerum . . . finire, ‘to prevent
an increase' (Juv. 6, 595).

9. adgnatis z ἐπιγόνοις, children born
after there is already an heir ι so in H.
5. 5, 5, where a similar prohibition
among the Jews is mentioned. Tacitus
appears here to overstrain the contrast ;
for it can be shown that the German
father sometimes exercised power to
kill, expose, or sell (cp. A. 4. 72, 4)
his children. But no doubt the expo-
sure of infants was much rarer than at
Rome, perhaps especially rare among
the best-known tribes, and if not sor-
bidden, contrary to sentiment.

[0. mores . . . leges, so opposed in
IIor. Od. 3. 24, 35. The German sanc-
tity of custom is contrasted with the
sutility of such laws as the ⁴ lex Papia
Poppaea' at Rome (see A. 3. 26, ι, soll.).
No written German laws appear to be
certainly traeeable earlier than the Salic
of the fifth century.

1 1. in omni domo, even those of the
wealthy classes. The subject of the
bringing up of children is suggested by
the last sentence os the preceding chap-
ter.
