CAP. 23—25. 81

robustior adligari se ac venire patitur. ea est in re prava
pervicacia; ipsi fidem vocant. servos condicionis huius per

commercia tradunt, ut se quoque pudore victoriae exsolvant.
25. Ceteris servis non in nostrum morem, discriptis per

familiam ministeriis, utuntur: suam quisque sedem, suos5
penates regit. frumenti modum dominus aut pecoris aut
vestis ut colono iniungit² et servus hactenus paret: cetera

1. adligari: this verb is used for the
simple ‘ligari ’ with the special sense of
binding the hands or feet: cp. ‘ anga, in—
quam, conliga’ (Plaut. Epid. 5. 2, 25).

2. ipsi fidem vocant. Tacitus would
not give such a term (‘honour ’) to the
adherence to a bargain so disgraceful
to both parties. He would rather call
it ‘ persistency ' (‘ pervicacia ').

servos condicionis huius, ‘slaves
in this position7⁷ those who become so
under these circumstances.

per commercia, ‘in traffic'; so of
persons ‘ venumdati' and ‘empti ' (Agr.

. 28, 5; 39, 2) : ‘tradunt‚' sc. ‘aliis’

3. se quoque: a sense of shame
would be felt by both parties. H. Schiitz
would read ⁶ se quisque.’

pudore victoriae exsolvant; so
‘pudore proditionis exsolvere' (H. 3.
61, 43 A· 6- 44> 7)-

4. Ceteris, in contrast to those above
described. Some would be slaves by
birth, others would become so by mar-
riage with such, or by captivity (cp. Agr.
28, 53 A.12. 27, 43 13. 56, 6> or by
judicial sentence, or inability to pay
fines, or even by voluntary surrender,
or sale .by husbands or parents (A. 4.
72, 4), to escape starvation: see Bp.
Stubbs, i. p. 84. Tacitus here describes
only one form of bondage, a kind of
serfdom approaching to latei· villeinage‚
and ignores, or rather expressly denies,
the existence of slaves in the house,
though such are clearly alluded to else-
where (see c. 20, 2).

in nostrum morem: cp. c. 16, 2.

&sex-ipris, &c. ‘with distinct sunc-
tions prescribed throughout the estab-
lishment.’ Such separate departments
or functions of Roman slaves 316 abun-
dantly given in inscriptions. Most edd.

adopt the reading ‘ discriptis ' ( z ‘ scri-
bendo distributis ’) ; a similar alteration
having been made in most places where
‘describo' is found in MSS. with this
meaning.

5. suam, &c.‚ ‘ each has a domicile
of his own and lords it there' like a
free householder) : on the sense of ‘ pe-
nates‚' cp. c. 15, 1. Tacitus is perhaps
contrasting the ‘cellae ⁷ of Roman slaves
(Hor. S. 1. 8, 8), and speaks rhetori:
cally, but the context shows that the
serf had land as well as dwelling. We
seem certainly to have here indicated
the existence of what are called depen-
dent villages, consisting of the mansion
of a lord with the cottages of serfs
clustering round 11, with small holdings
tenable at his pleasure; a condition of
things from which the manoi· of later
date arises. Some consider that this
was the prevalent type of German vil-
lage at this date, and that the statements
in c. 16, ’1, and 26, 1 can be explained
in accordance with this view (see D. W.
Ross, p. 124; F. Seebohm, pp. 339,
soll.). It is perhaps better to suppose
that there were variations which 'l‘aci-
tus omits to distinguish 1566 on c. 16, Ι).
Probably he would have found thc Ro—
man term‘ villa ⁹ (A.4. 73, 7; H. 5. 23, 4)
better suited than ‘vicus' to describe
such houses with dependent hamlets.

6. frumenti modum. Such rents
in kind are abundantly attested by later
evidence. 1t may bethatthe whole estate
was parcelled out on these terms among
the serss, but if a portion was retained
in hand by the lord we should suppose
that they had an additional obligation
to labour on it.

7. vestis, ‘ cloth‚' which they had to
spin and weave.
