non adulatione, ‘not out of servility'
*eausal abt).

nec tamquam facerent deas, ‘nor
as if they were deifying mortals‚' as the
Romans had deified Drusilla, sister of
Gaius (Suet. Cal. 245¹, Poppaea, wife of
Nero (A.16. 21, 2), and others. The
stress laid on ‘facerent' makes this not
wholly inconsistent with what is said in
H. 4. 61, 3 (ί fatidicas et mox augescente
superstitione arbitrantur deas’). This
sentence forms the transition to the next
chapter.

1. Deorum, &c. Tacitus is at
variance with Caesar, who says (f). 21,
5‘ ‘Deorum numero eos solos ducunt
quos cernunt, et quorum aperte opibus
iuvantur, solem et Vulcanum et Lunam ;
reliquos ne sama quidem acceperunt.'
Granting that the worship of Sun,
Moon, and Fire, existed at that date,
Caesar cannot but have been misin-
formed in supposing that there was no
other or higher worship (see SS. SS2.).
We should suppose that Tacitus here
selects for mention those most generally
worshipped3 the cults spoken of else-
waere (0· 39, 2; 40, 2; 43, 43 45, 3)
being described as those of particular
tribes or groups of tribes.

Mercurium. Tacitus here copies
the words used by Caesar (6. 17, 1) of
the Gauls: ‘deum maxime Mercurium
colunt.’ The ground for identification
is there added: ‘hunc omnium inven-
torem artium ferunt ; hunc viarum atque
itinerum ducem; hunc ad quaestus
pecuniae mercaturasque habere vim
maximam arbitrantur.’ Similar resem-
blances can be found in the German
XYuodan (the Norse Odin)‚ who is
expressly identified with Mercurius in
Paul. Diac. 1. 9 (cp. ‘Wednesdafz
‘ dies Mercurii’), and among whose
manifold attributes those of the culture
god were probably most prominent (see
Introd. p. 27), and in whose symbols
some discern a resemblance to the

‘ petasus‚' ³ caduceus‚' and ⁶ talaria⁷ (sec

certis diebus, ‘on stated days⁷
(cp. c. 11, 1): these were at the two
solstices (Z). For other instances os
human sacrifice, see c. 39. 2 ; 40, ς, and
note on c. 7, 2. According to Caesar
(6. 16) and Lucan (Ι, 444-447Ὗ, such
were very prevalent among the Gauls.

2. Herculem ae Martem. The
order of words is uncertain (see crit.
noter and Ritter thinks the name of
Hercules interpolated. but it is not
probable that Mars alone is mentioned.
The Hercules here spoken of (see c. 3, 1,
and note if conceived distinctly as one
of the great gods and yet not as Wuodan,
can only correspond with Donar (the
Norse Thor), whose special attributes
as the sender os thunder, &c.‚ resemble
those of Zeus or Jupiter, with whom
(cp. ‘Thursday'=‘dies Iovis⁷1 he is
more generally identified (see Introd.
p. 28). Mars is undoubtedly Tiu, the
Norse Tyr, whose name, surviving in
‘Tuesday' Q‘clies Martis'J, is linguis-
tically evidently another form of Zeus
(see on c. 39, 4, and Introd. l. l.).

3. concessis, best taken to mean such
as were permissible by general civilized
opinion, in contrast to human sacrifices,
which were revolting: cp. the contrast
‘ concessa’ and ‘ incesta’ in H 5. 4, 1,
and the use of ‘concessae voluptates ' of
those regarded as venial (Α. 13. 2, 2 3 14.
21, 5& Others take it to mean such as
are allowed by the gods, or pure animals,
in contrast to wild beasts or vermin.
Some needlessly alter to ‘consuetis'
Among the chief victims were the horse,
as the noblest, the bull, the ram, Sec. In
saying of the Germans ‘ neque sacrificiis
student‚’ Caesar (6. 21, 1) may only
mean that they laid no strcss on sacrifices·
as compared with the Gauls ‹ksce on
c. 7, 2,. Η6 uses the same words
’(6. 22, 1, of their agriculture, without
necessarily meaning that they had no
agriculture at all.
