scendis principibus, de pace denique ac bello plerumque in
conviviis consultant, tamquam nullo magis tempore aut ad

ergo detecta et nuda omnium inens, postera die

dum fingere nesciunt, constituunt, dum errare non possunt.

feasts are a real part of 1116(6011611111111’

so ‘simplicissime loquimur’ (ΗΛ . 1 5,8);
‘ convivalium fabularum simplicitas ’ (A.

Romans, who had learnt reticence even

preceding word.

Halm and Z. ‚giving ‘ergo' its force as
summing up the preceding words. K.

somewhat boldly, in the sense of ‘ con-
silium,' as subject of retractatur' 3 to
which, with the other stopping, some
such general subject as ‘res' must be
supplied from the sense. Some (with
Meiser) read ‘ res retractatur.' ’
