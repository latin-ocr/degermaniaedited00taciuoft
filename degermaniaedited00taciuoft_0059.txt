tribes, and to whom royal or princely
pedigrees are traced (Kemble‚ i 335,

1. Mannum. This name is evidently
from the root‘ man ’(the Indian‘ Manuss
Gk. Μίνως, &c.) and must have been
conceived as that of the ancestor not
of the Germans in particular but of the
human race.

Romanae stirpis origo ' (Aen. 12, 166).

conditores; the prevalent reading

‘conditoris' is probably an error of

assimilation to ‘gentis'3 ‘conditorem'
(perhaps only a correction in H) is
adopted by Holder. The expression
‘ condere gentem ' is found in Verg. Aen.

2. tris filios. Their names are to
be gathered from those given below
and would be‘ Ingvasss ‘Irmnas' (or
‘’Ermnas ), ‘I.stvas ’ The second name
suggests that of Irmin, but it is gener-
ally thought that all three are cognomina
of three great gods, F reyr (see on c. 40,
2), Tiu, and probably Wuodan ‹gsee on

. c. 9, 1), giving their names to tribes

united by a common worship. The
meaning of the cognomina is very doubt-
ful; they are explained by Mf. to be
‘the advancing,‘ ‘the exalted,’ ‘the
venerable.’ For other views, see SS.‚
SS2.

quorum nominibus, &e The same
three names (with those of the Vandili
and Peucini or Bastarnae) are given by
Pliny (4.14, 28, 993 as those of the
‘'genera or groups of Germans. Itis
probable from some readings of his text
and from the form of the personal names
above given that the first and third
here should be read ‘Ingvaeones' and
‘Istvaeones.' The second name is now
generally so read 1n preference to‘ Her—
miones ’(the MS. form also in Mela 3, 3,
32, and ιη Pliny). Pliny also gives the

nations belonging to each. making his In-
gaevones comprise the Cimbri, Teutoni,
and Chauci; his Istaevones the Rhenish
tribes; his Herminones the ‘Mediterra—
nei,' namely, the Suebi, Hermunduri,
Chatti, Cherusci. The three stems will
thus, as Grimm has pointed out,coincide
generally with the Saxons, Franks, and
Thuringians of later date. Pliny's
‘ Suebi' may be the Semnones of Taci-
tus, whose other Suebic tribes are, to
some extent, included under Pliny's
Vandili gcomprising the Burgodiones,
Varinnae, Charini, Gutones‘, and Peu-
cini or Bastarnae. These thre divi-
sions, or even Pliny’s five, can in any
case, hardly be taken to includ all the
furthest tribes to the east an north;
nor is the classifieation that of Tacitus
himself, who rather distinguishes the
Germans into non-Suebic and Suebic
(see c. 38, 13 46, 1).

3. ceteri, aec. to Pliny {see above)
only ‘ proximi Rhen0.' Probably T aei-
tus is here referring to older authorities,
to whom these three names seemed to
include all Germans known to them.

4. quidam, δερ. It is plain that the
names given below do not hang together
like those before mentioned, and do not
seem drawn from ancient minstrelsy.
The ‘ quidam' appear thus to be later
antiquaries‚ perhaps Roman, who de-
sired to find an explanation of names
not apparently included under the above
three, but belonging to groups rather
than to single pcoples.

natural in the scope given by antiquity

deo ortos, taken by Mf. generally
Cos (livine origin'), not with special
reference to the deity above-mentioned.
The conception of the unity of the racc

meant.
