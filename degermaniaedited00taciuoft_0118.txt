CORNELII TACJTI DE GERMANJA

‘marcentia pocula' (Stat. Silv. 4. 6,
56); more commonly ‘enfeebled' (as
in H. 3. 36, 2). Other causes, as in-
ternal sends (A. 11. 16, 1), and constant
warfare with the Chatti (A. 12. 28, 2),
had no doubt also weakened them.

inlacessiti, only here and in Agr.
20, 3.

nutrierunt, ‘have indulged in.’

1. inpotentes: cp. ‘ impotentia’
(ε. 35, 3)-

falso quiescas, ‘it is vain to think
of being at peace.’ They must at least,
like the Chauci (c. 35, 4), keep up a
strong defensive force.

2. nomina superioris (so nearly all
edd), ‘moderatiori and justice become
the titles of the stronger ' ; i.e. what is
so styled in their conduct is despised as
folly and cowardice (cp. ‘inertes ac
stulti') in the weak. The reading
‘ nomina superiori,' adopted by Halm,
would give the meaning ‘are names
(and nothing more) to the stronger'3
a sense somewhat supported by ‘nomen
exercitus’ H. 4. 15, 6), but less suit-
able to the context. Among other
suggestions are ‘ignominiae superiori’
(Halm), and ‘nomina ignaviae (cp.
Sen. Ep. 45, 7) superiori' (Miiller).

3. olim, during their peaceful life:
‘vocati sunt' is supplied from ‘ vocan-
tur' (cp. c. 2, 5).

4. Chattis victoribus. This victory
probably took place at the time (per—
haps Λ.1). 85) when Dio mentions (67.
5, 1‘, that the Cheruscan king Chario-
merus sought Roman aid against the
Chatti, but received from Domitian
only money.

believed to have planned out the suc-
cess which they really owed to luck.
Z. cites ‘ id illi in sapientiam cesserat,'
from a fragment of Sallust, and Tacitus
has ⁶ cedere in solatium ' (H. 2. 59, 5),
‘gloriam’ (A. 14. 54, 5).

5. tracti, ‘dragged in.' This al·
ternative for ‘tacti' is supported by
‘quae . . . ruina sua traxit ⁷ (11.3. 29, 2),
and ‘ Agrippinae pernicies .
cinam traxit ’ (A. 6. 26, 4).

F'osi, only here mentioned. It is
thought that they may have lived in
the district of Burgdorf, near the city
of Hanover, on the Fuhse, a small
tributary of the Aller.

6. ex aequo, ‘ equally' (ἐξ ἴσου), 50
in H. 2. 77, 3; 97, 2, &a Other such
adverbial expressions with this prep.
are found, as ‘ex facili ’ (Agr. 15, 1 ;
H. 3. 42, 1), &a

7. minores, ‘in inferior position.'

8. Eundem, ἃς. Η6 had turned
aside from the geographical order of
mention to bring in the Cherusci, and
now returns to it. It has been thought
that he may have wished to bring to-
gether the Cherusci and the Cimbri as
the most formidable German enemies
of Rome, but he certainly here does
not speak of the former as such. He
may have chosen to mention the Cimbri
last of the non-Suebic peoples, both as
being most remote, and because the
break in the narrative gave a good
place sor the appended digression. It
has been thought that this, or even the
whole chapter, show marks of being
a subsequent insertion by the writer.

sinum, ‘bend of land,' the ‘ingens
fiexus' of c. 35, 1 (Jutland). The
geography is less clear than that
