regarded by Germans as an auspicious
time for battle (Caes, 1. 50, 5), and for
many other things, as was also the full
moon (see Pramm.).

1. agendis rebus. Tacitus uses the
gerundive dative of purpose dependent
on adjectives only here in his minor
works, that dependent on verbs twice
gAgr. 23, 13 31, 3): both usages are
very common in the Annals.

2. noctium. Caesar says the same
of the Gauls (6. 18, 2), and a similar
practice is shown from words in Sans-
erit and other ancient Aryan languages,
and we have its survival in our ‘sen—
night‚’ ‘ fortnight.'

3. sio constituunt, sio condicunt,
‘ so run their appointments‚ their con-
tracts’: the latter verb is especially
a technical term of jrrrists, the former
is also used by them.

nox ducere diem. The idea of day
as the offspring of night is noted as com-
mon to many old mythologies. Cp. the
address to the sun in Soph. Trach. 94
ὃν αἰόλα νὺξ ἐναριζομένα τίκτει.

4. ex libertate vitium. In H. ·4.
56, 3, Tutor is made to say ⁶ Germanos

. . non iuberi, non regi, scd cuncta ex
libidine agere.’

ut iussi, ‘as ifcommandcd to attend?
To the regular ς( ungebotene') ‘concilia,'
no summons was issued: even at those
specially summoned (ί gebotene ⁹) atten—
dance was optionalto those not specially
concerned.

6. ut* turba placuit rso most recent
edd), ‘when the crowd is thought suffr-

cient': cp. ‘ubi satis placuere vires'
(Liv. 39. 30, 8), ‘cum res suae placuis-
sent' (Id. 33. 31, 6). Z. and others re-
tain the MS. ‘turbae,' with the sense of
‘when the mass are pleased to begin.’
In this and what follows the greater
‘ concilia ' seem clearly spoken of.

armati. This custom (cp. 6. 13, 1;
22, Ι, 8ζ6.) obtained also among the
Gauls (Caes. 5, 56; Liv. 21. 20, 1), but
was prohibited in German mediaeval
laws. Armed assemblies such as Tacitus
describes are still to be seen in some
parts of Switzerland: see Introd. p. 32.

per· sacerdotes. SS2. cites evidence
to show that the prominence of the
priest at the councils survived in Nor-
way during Christian times. They were
especial guardians of the sacred truce
observed at such times <⁵ Thingfn'ede ’).

7. tum, implying that they had not
such power at all times (cp. c. 7, 2).
A breach of the peace was regarded as
a sin against the godS.

8. prout aetas, &c. This can hardly
apply to the king (whose claim to be
heard could not depend on his age or
nobility‘)‚ but might be taken with ‘ prin-
ceps' in the sense of‘principum aliquis.’
It is'perhaps better to restrict ‘princeps'
as in 6. 10, 4, and to suppose ‘ceteri'
to be here supplied from the sense.

9. decus bellorum : cp. 6. 32, 2.

auctoritate . . . potestate (modal
abr), contrasted with ‘coercendi ius'
abore.

1 1. concutiunt, ‘ they clash ' so used
of clapping the hands by Ov. and Seri).
