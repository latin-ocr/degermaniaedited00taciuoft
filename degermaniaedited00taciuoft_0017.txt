PURPOSE OF THE TREATJ.s·E 5

the ‘ Dialogus’ represents his Ciceronian, we might say that the
Germania and Agricola represent his Sallustian period3 the influence
of that writer being traced in the plan of the latter work ¹, and
perhaps as a source of material in the former ², as well as in the style
and language of both 3.

When it is asked, what particular reasons may have led Tacitus to
choose this particular subject for such separate treatment, the explana-
tion is naturally sought in those parts of the treatise which show most
evidence of being written with a purpose: hence some have supposed,
from the descriptions of German hardihood and courage‚ and of the
disasters which Rome had suffered at their hands ⁰¹, that he desired to
turn men's thoughts from any idea of subjugating them3 others, that
he intended to lash the vices of effete civilization by contrast with the
virtues of healthy barbarism⁵; such explanations being plainly too
partial to account for the treatise as a whole, which we cannot suppose
to have been written for the mere purpose of bringing in a few
telling passages.

The abrupt beginning and ending of the work have suggested the
idea that it was written for insertion in the Histories⁴², and was for
some reason afterwards taken out and published separately. The
‘situs gentium' is certainly reckoned by Tacitus among the proper
subjects of history⁷; and we have evidence of his practice in the
account of Britain in the Agricola ⁸ and of the Jews in the Histories ⁹, as
well as of that of other writers ¹⁰. It is of course impossible to suppose
that such an excursus could have been intended to extend to anything
like the length of the present treatise : it is nevertheless possible that,
while on the one hand he may have come to think that he was writing
on no such era in the relations of Rome and Germany as to warrant
more than a very brief preparatory sketch, on the other, the richness of
material, the interest of the subject, the consciousness that he could
correct and improve upon the work of his predecessors, may have led
