46 CORNELI] TACJTJ DE GERMANJA

magna corpora et tantum ad impeturn valida: laboris atque 3

racteristics are generally so described
by writers; thus Horace speaks (Epod.
16, 71 of the ‘caerulea pubes' of Ger·
many &the Cimbri and Teutons), Lucan
N2, 51) of the ‘flavi Suevi,’ Juvenal (13,
164) of the blue eyes and curled golden
hair as common to the whole racc,
Caesar (1. 39, 1) makes the Gauls
themselves describe the Germans as of
huge stature, incredible valour and train-
ing, and striking terror by the fierceness
of their eyes) Much the same language
is however used by Romans of the
Gauls: see Introd. p. 17.

rutilae: cp. Agr. 11, 2. The
colour is called ‘rufus' by Seneca [de
Ira 3. 26, 3), ‘flavus' by others (500
above). Germans and Gauls could
produce this colour artificially or deepen
it with a kind of soap (Pl. N. H. 28. 12,
51, 1913 cp. ‘rutilatam crinem,’ H. 4.
61, 1), which was procured for the
purpose by Roman ladies (Ov. A. A. 3,
163; Mart. 8. 53, 20, &c.).

1. magna corpora: cp. Agr. 1.1.,
Caes. 1.1., also c. 20, 1; H. 5. 18, 1.
Sidonius speaks of a ⁴ Burgundio
septipes.' On the similar description of
Gauls, see Caes. 2. 30, 3, &c.

impetum, ‘a violent effort': Ger·
manicus is made to describe them simi-
larly (A. 2. 14, 5). Roman writers
often note the same quality in Gauls
[see Liv. 10. 28, 4, &c.)

laboris atque operum: ‘ opera'
are perhaps used specially of military
work, as in A. Ι. 35,1; 11. 18, 2, 850.
Caesar says (6. 21, 3), ‘ ab parvulis
labori et duritiae student,' but is speak-
ing of war and hunting.
⁸ 2. patientia, best taken as subst.: cp.

‘ nulla vulnerum patientia‘ (Ann. 2.
14, 5), and ‘ temperantia’ in c. 23, 2.

minimeque sitim, δίε. : cp. c. 23, 2.
The inability to bear heat is illustrated
by the rapidity with which the soldiers

3. assuerunt B b, assueuerunt C c.

of Vitellius (who were mostly Germans)
became demoralized in Italy (H. 2. 93,
1, &c.) The same is noted of Gauls
<Liv. l. 1., &c.).

3. tolerare, sc. ‘assueverunt,’ with
which ‘ tolerare’ is in turn supplied
below.

caelo solove, causal ablatives, re—
ferring respectively to ( frigora et
inediam.’

4. Terra, &c. The transition is sug-
gested by ‘ caelo solove.’

etsi, δια, ‘ though somewhat varying
in appearance': ‘specie' is abl. of
respect, ‘ aliquanto' of measure. Some
would read ‘ aliquantum ' τ ¹cp. ‘ multum
. . . differunt' (Agr. 24, 2).

in universum, ‘ generally ' ε
4: the adj. with this prep. is often used
in silver Latin for a modal adverb: cp.
‘in publicum '' (0. 21, 1), ‘in commune'
(0. 27, 3)-

5. aut silvis, &C., ‘is wild with
forests or hideous with swamps': cp.
‘ silvestribus horrida dumis ' (V erg. Aen.
8, 348). The chief forests are the
Hercynia, Bacenis, Abnoba, Caesia,
Teutoburgiensis. The morasses of the
Low Countries play an important part
in the campaigns of Germanicus (see
A. 1. 6 3-68).

6. ventosior, contrasted with ‘ umi-
dior’3 it being implied that the winds
make it drier.

satis, ‘in crops of grain ' (111 contrast
to ‘arborum ’); abl. of respect, as
perhaps ‘ferax oleo' (V erg. G. 2, 222),
and as used with ‘fertilis,’ ‘fecundus'
SS2. takes it as dat. comparing ‘ fecunda-
que nulli arva bono’ (Lucan 9, 696).
Pliny (18, 17, 44, 149) mentions oats
as the chief German cereal ; barley, and
probably wheat, were used to make
beer (0. 2 3, 1). According to Tacitus,
they grew no other crop but corn of
some kind (c. 26, 2).
