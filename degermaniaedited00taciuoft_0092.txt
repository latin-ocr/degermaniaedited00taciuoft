able of a modified meaning than the
‘cetera intecti ’ of c. 17, 1, but would
be taken literally, or nearly so, if he is
following Mela 3. 3 (‘nudi agunt ante-
quam puberes sunt: viri sagis velantur’),
or perhaps as in 6. 6, 2.

washed ξ 6. 22, 1), were unkempt as
compared with Romans. K. takes both

as slaves or soldiers, at Rome : cp. ‘pro-

‘ extrahunt' (6. 22, 1).

2. neo ancilliS, &c.‚ in strong con-
trast to the habits of fashionable ladies
at Rome, who had abandoned the old
Roman practice of personal nurture and
supervision of children (see Dial. 28, 4;
29, 13 Agr. 4, 2, &effi

of subject as in c. 18, 4‘: The same
expression is used in Dial. 29,1 (fat
nunc natus infans delegatur Graeculae
alicui ancillae'), and the word is a strong
one (015, 1). ἱ

3. servum. It is here admitted that
there were slaves in the house: see c.
25, Ι, and note.

educationis deliciis,
nurture': cp. ‘infantiam deliciis solvi—
mus’ (Quint. 1. 2, 6). It is noted that
this community of child life mitigated
the condition of slavery. The wife
herself was in a way bought (c. 18, Ι),
1116 children were ‘in manu patris.’

4. pecora. These were under the same
roof in the homestead.

(c. 13, 1).

5. adgnoscat, ‘ marks them as free ’,ε
a personification to signify that the free
show themselves the better men.

sera, &c. Caesar mentions (6. 21, 4)
the stress laid by Germans on youthful
purity of life. Cp. Mela 3. 3, 26 ((1011-
gissima apud eos pueritia est’).

inexhausta: cp. H. 5. 7, 4; Verg.
Aen. 10, 174; probably not earlier in
prose.

6. festinantur, often so used pas-
sively (as A. 6. 50, 6), 01 111 1116 active
transitively (as A. 1. 6, 4) by Tacitus,
as also by poets and Sallust. Here it is
a bold expression for ‘ festinanter collo-
cantur ' (their marriage is not hurried ’,1.

then considered marriageable at the age
of fifteen, but even this stands in con-
trast to the contemporary Roman cus-

afterwards permissible in Germany.

8. referunt, ‘repeat⁷: cp. c. 43, 1;
also ‘invalidique patrum referant ieiu—

sororum filiis, &c. Among seve-
ral peoples of Aryan speech (see SS².),
in case of the death of a father, the son
acquired ‘tutela’ over his sisters, if un-
