CORNELII TACJTJ DE GERMANJA

Haec in commune de omnium Germanorum origine ac3
moribus accepimus : nunc singularum gentium instituta ritus-
que, quatenus differant, quaeque nationes e Germania in
Gallias commigraverint, expediam.

28. Validiores olim Gallorum res fuisse summus auctorum
divus Iulius tradit3 eoque credibile est etiam Gallos in Ger-
maniam transgressos: quantulum enim amnis obstabat quo
minus, ut quaeque gens evaluerat‚ occuparet permutaretque
sedes promiscuas adhuc et nulla regnorum potentia divisas?

may have again had Seneca's words in
mind (Ep. 99, 24), ‘meminisse perse-
veret, lugere desinat! Somewhat simi-
lar words are ascribed to the dying
Germanicus (A. 2. 71, 5).

1. in commune, ί generally‚' cp. c. 38,
1; 4ο, 2, &c.; and see note on c. 5, 1.

2. accepimus, used frequently by
Tacitus and others of traditional or
secondhand knowledge, as in Dial. 1 2, 4;
28, 63 30,2; 40, 3, Agr. 11, 53 H. 5.
4, 53 A. 1. 8, 7; 2. 59, 2, &c. Peter-
son notes exceptions (on Dial. 1, 3). See
Introd. p. 1 2.

gentium . . . nationes, here used for
variation, without such distinction of
meaning as in c. 2, 5.

instituta ritusque, probably sy-
nonyms; but the latter may especially
refer to religious customs.

3. quatenus, ‘in so far as’; so in
c. 42, Ι ; elsewhere Tacitus uses the word
only with the force of ⁴ quoniam.'

quaeque, &c.; so Halm and Z.;
most others retain the MSS. ‘quae’3
some, with Reifferscheid, omit or bracket
the whole clause as an index to the fol-
lowing chapter intruded into the text.
Nipperdey would add ⁵ e Galliis in Ger-
maniam’ before ‘ e Germania?

4. expediam, ‘I will relate ’; so used
several times in Tacitus, and in poets,
also in Sall. Jug. 5, 3.

5. Validiores, sc.
norum.‘

summus, ‘of highest repute,' owing
to his knowledge of Gaul.

6. tradit3 in 6. 24, Caesar says that

the Volcae Tectosages had occupied a
tract bordering on the Hercynian forest,
and were still living there. Livy makes
such an occupatiori coincide with the
Gallie migration to Italy, which he
places in the time of Tarquinius Priscus

(5. 34, 4), but which was more probably
about ΒΕ. 400.

etiam, closely with ⁶ Gallos.' He
does not notice the possibility that the
Celts traceable in Germany (see c. 43,
Ι) might have been left behind in a
movement of the rest.

8. ut, ‘whenever'3
adoleverint ' (c. 31, ῐ).

evaluerat: cp. c. 2, 5. &c.

permutaretque,‘ and again exch ange
for others’3 or perhaps ‘ take in exchange
for their own,' as in. Hor. Od. 3. 1, 47.

9. promiscuas, ‘ unappropriated,‘
open to every one : cp. ‘ haud promisco
spectaculo’ (A. 14. 14, 4).

divisas, ‘partitioned,’ by kingdoms
able to resist invasion.

10. igitur, taking up the narrative
after a parenthetical passage: cp. Dial.
3, 1 ; Agr. 36, 2, &c.

inter, ‘the space between,' an ex·
tremely harsh abbreviation of the usual
expression ‘quantum inter' (A. 1. 60, 5 ;
H. 2. 14, 4), which Woifflin would read
here.

so ‘ut primum

Hercyniam silvam. Caesar, who
describes this tract as extending from
the source of the Danube to the borders
of Dacia (6. 25), identifies it with the
whole highland region of south Ger·
many. The portion here mentioned is
