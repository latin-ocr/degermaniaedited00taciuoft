1. omnium. We should suppose
the reference to be to all those men-
tioned since e. 30, but the Usipi and
Tencteri cannot really be included, nor
is it possible to suppose that the Chauci
bordered anywhere on the Chatti. The
suggestion (see SS.) that he has con-
sused them with the Chaulci (who are
taken to be the same as the Angrivarii),
and has for the moment ignored the
Cherusci as no longer independent of
the Chatti, is not very probable.

obtenditur, so used in Agr. 10, 2,
&c. Halm and Mf. read ‘ optenditur.’

donec, &c., ‘till it takes a bend ex-
tending (southwards) to the Chatti.‘

3. sed et (cp. c. 15, 3) implent.
In Veli. 2. 106, 1 this tribe is described as
‘infinita numero, immensa corporibus.'

4. nobilissimus, explained by what
follows. They are contrasted with
other Germans.

5. impotentia, ἀκράτεια, ‘ ungovern-
ableness'3 often used in this sense, as
is also ‘ impotens.'

secreti, ‘retired': the Romans could
only reach them through several other
peoples or by sea.

8. quod, ut, &c., ‘that it is not by
aggression that they win the right to
stand preeminent.' For ‘ agere ’ in the
sense of ‘se gerere' cp. Agr. 5, 2; 7, 53
9, 2, &c.; for a similar clause as object
of ⁴ adsequor’ cp. c. 46, 5.

9. exercitus. Those who do not
take this to be a gloss on the following
words would explain it to mean an
organized army, as distinct from ‘arma,'
and place it between commas, taking
‘plurimum,' &c., as in apposition. It
cannot well be object of'‘poscat,' as
‘ res poscit⁷ (absol.) is a formula (cp.
c. 44, 2; H. 1. 79, 7,· 2. 5, 1, &c.).
Others read ‘ad exereitum,’ or ‘exer-
citui,' or ‘ plurimum enim.’

1 0. et quiescentibus, &c., ‘and while
they are at peace they have the same
character ' (that of being ready for war).
The corresponding clause to ‘eadem
fama ' is left to be supplied from sense.

mer, north-east of the latter.

Cherusci. The name is taken to
mean ‘swordsmen.‘ They lived be-
tween the middle NYeser and middle
Elbe, bordering in part on the Angri-
varii (A. 2. 19, 3), and known to Caesar
(6. 10, 5) as parted from the Suebi
(perhaps Chatti) by the silva Bacenis
(Hartz). Their district would thus
answer to parts of Hanover, Brunswick,
&c. At the date of this treatise,Tacitus
seems hardly to have been aware ot‘
their prominence, under Arminius, in
the resistance to Rome from ΑΛ). 9—17;
