THE ACCOUNT GJVEN BV TACJTUS 17

determining the ethnology of the Venedi and Fenni he has no test of
language to apply, and is only able to speak of their mode of life and
customs¹.

Another universal characteristic of the Germans on which he lays
stress‚ that of their physical appearance ², leads to a difficulty of which
we should think that he ought himself to have been aware; for the
peculiarities on which he insists, the ruddy hair, flashing blue eyes,
stalwart limbs‚ and others, agree equally with all Roman description of
the Gauls ³, and it would seem that on this point, as well as in several
of their other qualities⁴, no clear distinction between the races was
noticed by Greeks or Romans, and that it was long before they
were marked off at all. To Greeks at an earlier date all the north-west
of Europe was peopled by Κελτοί or Γαλάται 5: nor does Cicero distin-
guish the nationality of the Teutons and Cimbri from that of those
who had once pillaged Rome under Brennus ⁶. Caesar, the first to
distinguish clearly between Gauls and Germans, rests his distinction
not on physique‚ but on differences of religion and customs⁷; and
Strabo, writing about Aa). 10—20, is aware of no stronger physical
difference than that the German is an exaggerated Celtss. It should
be remembered that by the time of Tacitus the Gauls had been so
greatly changed and enervated by a century and a half of subjection
as to be no longer liable to be confounded in respect of warlike spirit
and qualities⁹‚ and perhaps less so than formerly even in physica}
appearance¹⁰‚ with the fierce and unchanged Germans.

³ Cp. the terms used by Livy (38. 17,
3) : ‘ procera corpora, promissae et
rutilatae comae,’ &c.: yet these very
characteristics are taken by Tacitus in
Agr. 11, 2 to mark off the Caledonii.
as Ger-mans, from the rest of the Britons,
who are ‘ Gallis similes.' v

Gauls and Germans, see on c. 4, 2—33

’δ The former term is found as early
as Hdt.‚ the latter in Arist. Polyb. διο.
The two are distinguished by some
writers, as Diod. 5. 30.

οἴους εἰρήκαμεν τοὺς Κελτούς. The exd-
dence of anthropology would go to
show a considerable difference in form
of skull, and therefore in physiognomy,
between any Gaulish type and that of
the ancient Germans or scandinaviam,
of whom the nearest modern represen-
tatives are the Swedes (see Taylor,
Aryans, pp. loz-109). But no Roman
writer seems to notice this.

types of race in Gaul, answering to the
