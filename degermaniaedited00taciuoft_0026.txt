mention any tributaries ¹. The ocean frontier is generally character-
ized as deeply recessed and containing islands of vast magnitude23
while the land is spoken of as taking at a certain point a great bend
northward ³. In indicating no other natural boundary eastward than
the Carpathians‘* he is more consistent with his own conception of
the extent of Germany in that direction than he would have been if
he had followed Mela and Pliny in drawing the line at the Vistula ⁵.

He is satisfied to distinguish the vast area included within these
limits into two main portions‚ the ⁹ ›ist plains of the north and
north-west, and the forest and mount ,η tract of the south and south-
east ¹³. Of the rivers by which it is intersected, he specifies only the
Elbe (and that incorrectly τ); of the forests he notices only the
Hercyniam, and both these apparently for special reasons ⁹. His
work, in short, stands in no comparison with professed geographical
treatises‚ and he cannot be assumed to be ignorant of all that he has
not mentioned ¹0.

His mapping out of the country among the several tribes is
marked by much of his general vagueness, and would probably have
been far clearer if rivers and other natural features had been taken
more account of. Sometimes definiteness is given by the mention
of the Rhine or Danube, the ocean, or a mountain tract Π, very often
the position of this or that people is given only relatively to that
of others, as ‘a fronte,' ‘a tergQ' ‘a latere 1²,' and is more and more
vaguely indicated, as is but natural, the more he recedes from the

frontier. We have, however, certainly no earlier extant account in
