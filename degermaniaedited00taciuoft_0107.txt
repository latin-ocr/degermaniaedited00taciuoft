vives in the districts of Over and Neder
Betuwe. The name is thought to be
from a root ‘ bat ' (‘ able ³) with a Celtic
ending, also their towns have Gallie
names, as Batavodurum (H. 4. 20, 3)
and Lugdunum tLeyden), and they
counted with the Gallie ‘civitates’ in
the diet at Lugdunum (Lyons‘) : see
Mommsen, Hist. v. E. T. i. 97.

non multum, &c., ‘not much of the
river-frontier ’ ; ‘ extrema Gallicae orae ’
ζ Η. 4. 12, 2).

1. Chattorum, &c. τ 566 H. 1.1. The
fact is questioned (see Z).

3. in quibus . . . fierent, ‘ in which
they were destined to become’ ε cp.
‘in quibus . . . victoriam ederetis’ (Agr.
34, 3)-

honos, explained by the more specific
words following. The expression would
show that, aster their rising with Civilis
in A.D. 69—70 (of which nothing is here
said), they had submitted on honourable
terms ; but their troops appear to have
been no longer kept together, or under
Officers chosen from themselves (Momm-
sen, l. l. p. 144).

4. nam nec, &c., ‘ for they are neither
insulted by tribute, nor ground down by
the tax-sarmer’ (1.6. by ‘ vectigalia’) z
cp. ‘ atteri ' (Agr. 9, 5), &c. They are
represented as themselves making a
similar boast (H. 5. 25, 3).

5. collationibus (dat. with ‘ex-
empti’), gifts for special purposes, such
as horses for service, &c., often repre-

sented as voluntary (A. 1. 71, 3), but
really burdensome (2. 5, 35. Hence it
is said in praise of Trajan ‘ collationes
remisisse' (Pl. Pan. 41).

6. tela atque arma, offensive and
defensive arms. They furnished some
9000 foot and 1000 horse to the army
QMommsen).

7. reservantur: cp. ‘quibus . . . .
reservemur ' (Agr. 31, 3).

Mattiacorum. These lived in the
district of Mt. Taunus; their ‘fontes
calidi' (Plin. 31. 2, 17, 20) being those
of Xl'iesbaden. They had become part
of the empire, and mines were worked
in their country in A.D. 47 (A. 11. 20,
4). They joined Civilis [H. 4. 37, 4)
but had now returned to their allegiance,
and from this time are permanently
incorporated as the ⁴ civitas Mattia-
corum Taunensium ' (see Mommsen, 1.1.
p. 149. They are connected with the
Chatti, whose town was called Mattium
(A. 1. 56, 6), and are mentioned here
owing to the similarity ostheir position
to that of the Batavi.

9. imperii, probably best taken as
genit. obj. after ‘ reverentiam?

sede finibusque, abl. os respect:
the words are virtually synonymous, as
arc also ‘ mente ani1noque.'

ιο. agunt, as in c. 19, 1, &o

11. nisi quod, &c. The best sense
seems to be given by taking ‘adhuc'
with ‘acrius' (cp. c. 19, 3, and note).
