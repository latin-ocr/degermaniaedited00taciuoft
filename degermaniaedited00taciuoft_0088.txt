CORNELII TACJTJ DE GERMANJA

feras et detracta velamina spargunt maculis pellibusque be—
luarum, quas exterior Oceanus atque ignotum mare gignit.
nec alius feminis quam viris habitus, nisi quod feminae saepius 3
lineis amictibus velantur eosque purpura variant, partemque
5 vestitus superioris in manicas non extendunt, nudae brachia

ac lacertos; sed et proxima pars pectoris patet.

severa illic matrimonia, nec ullam morum partem magis

laudaveris,

nam prope soli barbarorum singulis uxoribus

contenti sunt, exceptis admodum paucis, qui non libidine,
sed ob nobilitatem pluribus nuptiis ambiuntur.

9. ob libidinem C.

ruder tribes could not then weave for
themselves.

ut quibus, &e ‘as those do who
have‚' δῖε. Cp. the similar ellipse in
c. 22,1; and the use of ‘ut' in c. 2, 4,
&c. For thev sense of ⁴cultus,' cp.
c. 6, 2.

1. detracta, sc.⁴ feris': for ‘ velamina,'
⁴ vellera‚’ or ⁴ velumina ⁷ have been sug-
gested.

maculis pellibusque, hendiadys for
⁴ maculatis pellibus.’ They sew on
patches of other speckled hides, prob-
ably of sealskins. Cp. ‘sparsitque co-
loribus alas' (Verg. Aen. 7, 191).

2. exterior Oceanus, explained by
‘ignotum mare'3 probably the Baltic
is meant. The traders in this region
would be the Suiones of c. 44, 2.

3. habitus, so used of clothing in
Agr. 21, 3; A. 1. 69, 5, &c.

4. amictibus, distinguished by some
from ⁴ vestitus} as the ⁴ sagum ’ from the
⁴ vestis,⁷ but more probably intended as
a general term to mean that the material
of their clothing, as a whole, was flax
(that of the men being probably woollen).
That the Germans spun flax at this time
is attested by Pliny 319. Ι, 2, 8), a'nd
implements sor spinning and weaving
are as old in Europe as the Swiss lake-
dwellings =Taylor, p. 171).

purpura, a border or stripes of some
colour resembling purple dye.

5. vestitus, the tunic, as distinct
from the ⁴ braccae'; ‘superioris' by
enallage (cp. c. 27, 2) sor 'superiorem
partem,' the part to which sleeves would
be attached in the case of the men.

Such seems to be the contrast best suited

10. plurimis all, text Halm.

ambiunt H.

to the passage, though SS2. takes the
comparison to be rather with the ⁴ stola ’
of Roman women. On the Antonine
column the women are represented with
an undergarment reaching to the feet,
and a short tunic over it. This tunic
has usually long sleeves, but in some
instances (see Bartoli, pl. 17, 49, 63>
exactly answers to the description here
glven.

brachia ae lacertOS, the fore-arm
and arm.

6. sed et: cp. c. 8, 3.

quamquam, i. e. although their cloth-
ing may seem barely decent, their chas-
tity is remarkable. This forms the
transition to a new subject. This word
is so used in the prin cipal sentence with
the force of ‘however’ in Dial. 28, 3;
33, 5·

8. prope soli barbarorum. This
statement is somewhat bold and does
not hold good of all Germans. SS.
shows that polygamy was not forbidden
by their ancient laws, nor unusual in
north Germany, besides being excep-
tionally practised elsewhere, as 'l'acitus
notes.

9. exeeptis, &c.‚ as an instance,
Ariovistus had two wives (Caes. 1.

libidine, causal abl. answering to
⁴ ob nobilitatem.'

10. pluribus, ⁴ more than one ': most
edd. retain ⁴ plurimis ' (⁴ several ³).

ambiuntur, so ‘conubiis ambire'
(Verg. Aen. 7, 3335 ‘auxiliis ambiri'
(H. 4. 51, 2). Here it is used with
‘libidine' by zeugma, in the sense of
⁴ plures uxores habent.’
