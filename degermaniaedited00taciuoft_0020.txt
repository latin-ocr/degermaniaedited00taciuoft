SECTION IV.

LANGUAGE AND STYLE.

On the style of Tacitus as a whole, reference must be made to
other works ¹, and attention must here be briefly directed to a particular
phase of it2. To pass through different phases is common to most
authors whose style is strongly pronounced, and whose work is
spread over many years33 and in the case of Tacitus we have the
additional circumstance of a change of pursuit in middle life from
forensic oratory to historica] composition, leading him to form a
style in which the new study was blended with the old.

In the ‘Dialogus4’ the style, no less than the choice of subject,
wholly bespeaks a rhetorician, though of a type then perhaps some-
what antiquated, one seeking to reform a decadent eloquence hythe
study of the old great masters, especially Cicero, while the usages
of the silvei· age and special Tacitean style are so sar latent that
a superficial reader would hardly notice them.

The Agricola and Germania, separated by some fourteen years
from this treatise 5, and by rather more than that time in the other
direction from the Annals ⁶, are not strongly marked off in date from
the Histories ⁷, yet a comparison of them even with that work would
show that they are fully inter-mediate in style, and represent a period
in which the historiari is still at times subordinate to the orator, who
again is somewhat holding a balance between the more Classical
type of the ‘Dialogus’ and that of the pleader of his day, compelled
to conform more or less to the exigeucies of a fashion which had

these authors had survived. Among
modern writers a signal instance of such

treatises, the most complete is that ot
Draeger, the most concise that of Gan-
trelle.

2 On the gradual development of the
style of Tacitus, the most valuable trea-
tise is that of E. Wolfflin, in ‘ Philologus,'
xxv. pp. 92-134.

³ Wfflfflin remarks that differences
have been noted between the Catiline
and Jugurtha of Sallust and between
the first decade of Livy and later por·

of that treatise. the reader must be
referred to Peterson's Introd. Sect. iv.

⁵ Peterson gives reasons ‘xIntrod. p.
xviii) for supposing the ‘ Dialogus' to
have been written about A.D. 84—85.

ὓ The completior] ofthe Annals would
be dated about A.D. 116.

⁷ The latter were already in course of
composition when these treatises were
published ¹*see above, p. 4).
