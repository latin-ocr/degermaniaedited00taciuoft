76 CORNELI] TACJTI DE GERMANJA

quam amicitias necesse est; nec inplacabiles durant: luitur
enim etiam homicidium certo armentorum ac pecorum numero
recipitque satisfactionem universa domus utiliter in publicum,
quia periculosiores sunt inimicitiae iuxta libertatem.

5 Convictibus et hospitiis non alia gens effusius indulget.2
quemcumque mortalium arcere tecto nefas habetur; pro for·
tuna quisque apparatis epulis excipit. cum defecere, qui
modo hospes fuerat, monstrator hospitii et comes ; proximam
domum non invitati adeunt. nec interest: pari humanitate3

5. aliqua Bb. 7. defecerit c.
1, neeesse est, it is enforced by

‘illud ex libertate vitium’ (c. 11, 3).
German opinion and moral sentiment.

For a nearly similar use of ‘ iuxta,’ See

With them the sacredness of the family
tie and the promptness to resent inju-
ries were exceptionally strong.

nec . . . durant, ‘nor yet do they
(the feucis]- continue irreconcileable.’
The reconciliation of homicide, as the
greatest of feuds 'Q‘ etiam homicidium ⁷),
implies that of those rising from lesser
causes.

luitur, &o it is thought by some
that the acceptance of this satisfaction
was not compulsory upon the relatives
of the slain; and it appears not to have
always ended the feud (see note below).
The principle, however, prevails in some
form almost as generally as that of
blood yengeance itself. Instances may
be seen in the Homeric poems, as in 11.
9. 632, soil.. and the ποινὴ ἀνδρὸς ἀπο-
φθιμένου of Il. 18. 498. In old German
laws the compensation sine is called
‘werageld,' ‘'werigelt,’ or ‘ wergeld‚’
and is assessed by a regular code ac-
cording to the rank of the slain person
{see Kemble, ch. x). For the payment
of fines in cattle, cp. c. 12, 2.

3. universa domus. All members
of the family became parties to the-com—
pact to drop the feud. Laws are found
imposing penalties for persistence in it
after compensation. ‘ Satisfactionem ac—
eepit ' is found in Caes. 6. 9, 8.

in publicum, ‘ as regarding the
state': this phrase is used in several
places by Tacitus, with the force of
‘publices as A. 2. 48, 1; 11. 17, 43
12. S, 3: see note on e. 5, 1.

4. iuxta libertatem, ‘ by the side of
liberty ⁷ Ξ ‘inter liberos' ; i. e. ‘ where
there is no strong legal control? Cp.

c. 30 3; and another, founded chiefly
on Sallust, in A. 6. 13, 1.

5. Convictibus et hospitiis, ‘en-
tertainments and hospitalities,’ feasts to
each other, and reception of strangerS.
The previous subject leads Tacitus to
spe-ak of the treatment of those who,
though outside the family, were pro·
tected by custom; the housemaster being
responsible for the safe conduct of the
stranger to the next house. The hos-
pitality of the Germans is noted in simi-
lar terms by Caesar (6. 23, 9) : ‘hospitem
violare fas non putant; qui quaque de
causa ad eos venerint, ab iniuria pro·
hibent, sanctos habent, hisque omnium
domus patent victusque communicatur ’ ;
it is also illustrated from old poems,
and enforced by old law 2 see SS.

effusius indulget, ‘ gives freer rein
to ' : cp. ‘indulge hospitio ' (Verg. Aen.
4, 51).

6. pro fortuna, ‘according to his
means’; so in A. 14. 21, 2; cp. ‘for-
tunae' in c. 46, 53 Agr. 31, 2. Here
it is taken closely with ‘apparatiss ‘ well-
furnished ' (cp. ‘ apparatis accipere epu-
lis‚' Liv. 23. 4, 3, and the substantive
in c. 14, 4; 23, 1).

7. cum defecere, sc. ‘epulae' or
‘cibi' (cp. c. 24, 3). In later times
two or three nights were the limit for
which the right of hospitality could be
claimed.

8. hospes, ‘ the host.’

monstrator, &c., ‘is his guide and
companion to another lodging': this
subst. (Verg, Ov.‚ &c.) does not appear
to be in earlier prose.

9. nee interest, ‘there is no‚distinc·
