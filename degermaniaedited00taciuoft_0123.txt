1. servis: German slaves generally
had close cropped hair.

3. rarum, 56. ‘est,' ‘the practice
(ὅ obliquare crinem nodoque substrin-
gere ') exis ts, but is rare, and confined
to y'outh. U hat was really character-
istic of the Suebi was its universality,
among all free men and at every time
of life. Some 51οΡ differently, so as to
take‘ rarum' as in apposition with
’1610101161113Γ116 causal ablativ es ‘co-g
natione’ and‘ imitatione' give reasons
not for the practice being rare, but for
its existence elsewhere at all.

4. horrentem, ‘ unkempt.’

retorquent3 Halm, Mn, and Z. thus
follow Madvig. Some such meaning is
required, and it hardly seems possible
to extract it, even under a figure of
rhetoric, from ‘ retro sequuntur,’ which
is no true equivalent to the ‘capillos . . .
retro agere' of Quint. 11. 3, 160.

ac saepe, &c. The text (see crit.
11016) has been very variously treated.
It seems best (with Halm, Mn, Pramm.,
Z.) to treat ‘ solo’ as a gloss on ⁶ ipso.'
Those who retain both words generally
take ‘ solo‘ with the force of ‘solum,'
to which others would alter it. For
other readings and interpretations see
SS2. Some also read, with the best
MSS„ ‘religatur.’ It is in any case
plain that Tacitus means here to
describe a different and exceptional
mode, that of those who, instead of
knotting the hair at the back of the
neck (ep. ‘nodo substringere’), gather
it up 011 1116 1οΡ of the head. The

the Antonine column show neither
mode, but have wild and unkempt hair;
but figures with the hair gathered into
such a knot on the crown as is here
described are found on the column of
Trajan, and are taken by Fabretti
(Syntagma, p. 16) to be possibly Suebic
auxiliaries.

<kings and nobles) wear their hair yet
more ornately,' adding artificial height
to the structure. Such a 6115 10111 is
found among the princes of the Franks,
Goths‚ and Vandals. Cp. the descrip:
tion in Sid. Apoll. of Theodoric:
⁵ capitis apex rotundus, in quo paululum
a planitie frontis in verticem caesaries
refuga crispatur.' The following words
refer to these only; the simple knot of
ordinary men, as seen in the figures
above referred to, being too small for
any imposing effect.

6. ea eura formae, ‘in this point
they care for their personal appearance.'

innoxia, explained by the following
words.

7. in altitudinem, &c.: the asyn-
deton is adversative, and the prep.
expresses result, as in 6. 24, 2, Sec. ‘ Et
