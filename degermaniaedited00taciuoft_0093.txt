children, as ‘avunculus,' or ‘avus
minor.’ It is worthy of notice that
Civilis placed two sons of his sisters in
high commands (H. 4. 33, 13 5. 20, Ι).

apud patrem. SS.‚ SS2.‚ Mf.‚ and
Pramm. read ‘ ad’; such preps. being
often varied in Tacitus.

1. quidam, certain German tribes.

sanctiorem artioremque, i. e. that
the mother'sbrotherwas a nearer relation
even than the father. This idea seems
clearly to be a survival from the primi-
tive state of society called matriarchal,
in which marriage was frequently poly-
androus, and relationships and inheri-
tance were reckoned through the mother,
whose eldest brother had the rights of
headship.

2. exigunt, ‘insist on it,' i. e. on the
delivery of hostages thus related to the
contracting parties z ‘ magis ' sc. ‘ quam
filios?

3. tamquam, ‘ on the ground that':
cp. c. 12, 2.

latius, as embracing more relation-
ships.

4. heredes tamen, i. e. this tie does
not affect inheritance. In the term ‘li-
beri ' all direct descendants are included;
but Tacitus does not distin guish between
sons and daughters, the latter of whom
took anciently no share, and subse-
quently but a small share of the inheri-
tance. Nor does he state what took
place if a man left daughters only, nor
mention the father as heir to a ehildless
son. Some custom of primogeniture is
alluded to in e. 32, 4.

nullum testamentum. This is in
accordance with Indian and other early

usage, but in strong contrast to Roman
law. ⁴ It is doubtful whether a true
power of testation was known to any
original society except the Roman '
(Maine, Anc. Law, p. 196 v, from whence
it was subsequently introduced into
Germany.

7. quanto maior3 most edd. here
follow Halm: ‘tanto' is plainly cor-
rupt, and ‘ quo' not supported by Taci-
tean usage: cp. Dial. 38, 2 3 A. 1. 81, 4;
4. 18, 1; 6. 34. 5.

gratiosior, ‘in more esteem'; not
elsewhere in Tacitus, but frequent in
Cic. &c.

8. nee ulla orbitatis pretia, a great
contrast to Rome, where the servility
of legacy-hunters gave a great social
power to those who were wealthy and
childless. See Hor. 2. 5. 10, foll. ; Juv.
4, 19; 1 2, 99, and many other referencts
in note to A. 3. 25, 2, and in Friedl. i.
p. 567, foll. ⁴ Pretia' (cp. c. 24, 2]÷‚ for
the more usual ‘ orbitatis praemia' il'lin.

9. Suscipere, &c Th1s subject and
that of friendship connects itself with
that of inheritance.

inimicitias, ‘Fehden' (‘ feuds'). The
duty ofexacting blood vengeance ‘Blut-
rache') sor homicide devolved on the
whole sept, and especially on the nearest
of kin. It is found very generally in
ancient institutions, is recognized even
in the Mosaic code, and receives various
restrictions and modifications from law-
givers, gradually passing into legal re-
dress. 55². notes that it is even now
not altogether extinct amongr Europe-an
peoples, as the Albaniam.
