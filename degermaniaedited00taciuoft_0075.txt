2. est simplex C.

profanoS, qui deum imagines mortalibus
materiis in species hominum effingant;
summum illud et aeternum neque imi-
tabile neque interiturum. ' The associa-
tion of such ideas with the solitude of
a grove is described by Seneca (Ep. 41,
3); ‘ secretum loci et admiratio umbrae

fidem tibi numinis facit? It is,
howev er, extremel3 questionable whether
1116 German religion 11135 at that date as
spiritual as Tacitus 1113κ65 it.

1 Auspicia sortesque These are
distinguished in ᾗ 3, and the nature of
both is explained in the chapter. The
lot is here described as preliminary to
divination.

ut qui maxime, ‘they pay attention,
as those do who pay most ',; i. e. pay
as much attention as any¹ people. For
3116311) 511111131 ellipse, cp. te sic colam

.ut quem maxime ’((Lic. ad Fam 13.
62), ‘grata ea 165 ut quae maxime'
(Liv. 5. 25, 9), 816.

sortium consuetudo simplex, ‘the
custom of 635 ting lots is uniformj
Caesar does not describe the custom,
but attests its existence (see notes be-
low), and later evidence (see S82.) does
not bear out the uniformity here
affirmed.

2. frugiferae, probably such trees as
the elder, junipen beech, or oak. There
is thus no contradiction to c. 5, 1.

in surculos amputant, ‘ cut up into
small 3vands.’

3. notis, 66113136161·5’; 1116 context
would show that these were ‘runae‚’ or
mysterious marks, whether initial letters
of significant words or other symbols
intelligible to the person consulting.

super candidam vestem,‘ on a white
610111’(50 ι165115’111 6. 40, 2, 5). SS'.
shows this to be part also of 13161 ritual
in casting lots.

5. consuletur all, text Halm.

4. temere ae fortuito, ζ311311610111,
and as they chance to sall': the first
has chiefly a subjective, the latter an
objective meaning, but they are prac-
tically synonyms: so ‘nec temere nec
casu' (Cic. N. D. 2. 2, 6); ‘forte 36
16111616’ (Sen. Ben. 1. 15, 1).

publice, ‘ sor the communit3⁷,’ in con-
trast to ⁶ privatim ' (ς for individuals').

5. consultetur,so read on the ground
that the subjunctos habitual action is
required, as in 6. 7, I ; 17, 1, stc. ² Con-
sulatur' is read by 311611, &o

sacerdos civitatis, On the German
priests, see c. 7, 2, &c. There may have
been several in each ⁴ civitas, ’ but pro-
bably some one was preeminent, as we
hear later· (.Amm 28 · 1,4) of a per-
manent chief priest entitled‘ sinistus’
(‘ eldest' ) among the Burgundians. Such
an office would be of great importance
for preservin g tribal worship, and thereby
tribal unity. It may probably 113116 been
once identical with the kingly office, 35
111 501116 63565 it continued to be (see on
0· 44, 3>-

pater familiae. The divination
practised by ‘matres familiae‚’ men-
tioned by Caesar (sec on c. 7, 2), was
also accompanied by the use of lots.

6. ter singulos tollit, ‘takes ul)
three, one at a time.’ Caesar gives the
account of a captive (1. 53, 7) ‘de se
ter sortibus consultum . . . utrum . . .
necaretur, an . . .reserva1'etur. ’ Α 13161·
instance is given by 11611111 of a king,
who‘ per 1165 (1165 semper tribus vicibus
501 tes suo more 111111611313

7. interpretatur, reads their mean-
ing‚' according to 1116 111165 ol oracle
lore.

S. prohibuerunt‚used 01 the sortes
as of evil omens in Roman augury.

nulla . . . consultatio (56. ‘ sortium').
