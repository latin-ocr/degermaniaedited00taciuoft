1. gentis appellationes, ‘ group
names' : it is possible that the four here
mentioned are given as instances, not as
a full enumeration. None of them are
mentioned further in this treatise except
the Suebi (s'ee note above* Of the

others, the Marsi appear as a specific
people 1n the campaigns of Germanicus
(A. 1. 5,0 6; 2. 25 2), but are said by
Strabo 1Ϊ7. 1, 3, 290) 10 have retreated
into the interior, where they probably
broke up into subdu 1510115 the Gam-
brivii, mentioned only by Strabo (l 6.)
with other central tribes, appear from
their name to be connected with, per—
haps a parent stem of, the Sugambri;
the Vandili (011 whose subdivisions,
given by Pliny, see note 2110161 were
evidently known to Tacitus only in their
separate names, and rather as part of
the Suebi than distinct fiom them, and
in the latter part of the second century,
when they begin to be prominent in his-
tory, are a people dwelling in part of
the mountain district of Bohemia, and
afterwards still nearer the Danube.

these are real and ancient namesss as
opposed to that of‘ Germani' which
is an ‘inventum nomen' (‘ made up)

‘quidam’ plainly extends to‘ vocaren-

as part of it; but some would prefer
to supply ‘ 511111,Ἴ and to take it as an

earliest mention of the name ‘ Germani’
is in the Fast. Cap. under the year 532,
11.(;. 222 srecording the victory of Mar-
cellus over the Insubrian Gauls), but
this is taken to be an insertion of Au-

gustan times. The name appears to

Plut. Crass. 9), and to have been made
familiar chiefly by Caesar.

qui primi, &c. The words seem to
follow Caesar's account (Β. G. 2, 4, 1)
of the supposed German origin of the
Belgae generally (⁴ plerosque Belgas esse
ortos ab Germanis, Rhenumque antiqui-
tus traductos . . . ibi consedisse, Gallos—
que . . . expulisse’), but the real reference
is probably to those more distinctly
called by Caesar, ‘ Germani 615 Rhenum
in colentes‚' i. e. the Eburones and others,
living in the district afterwards known
as that of the Tungri (B. G. 2. 3, 4;
4, 10), and apparently represented by
them.

4. nuno Tungri, sc. ‘ vocentur’: one
tense is thus supplied from another in
c. 36, 2 ; 41,1. This name is well
known from Tacitus (cp. Agr. 36, 1,
&c.) ,and Plin. ma„ and from inscrip-
tions, as that of auxiliaries 1n the Roman
army, and their name survives in that 01
Tongres or Tongern, near Lie'ge.

5. Germani. As the name appears
to originate in Gaul, the most probable
explanations are those based on Celtic
roots, making it 6111161εβοὴν ἀγαθοί 01
‘neighbours ’ (ί gairmans ³) It appears
from Strabo (7. 1, 2, 290) that the Romans
thought the name to be of their inven-
tion, and to signify the ‘ genuine' Gala-
tae or Celts, in distinction to the de—
generate Gauls. Tacitus does not appear
to have shared this error, but to have
thought that they acquired the name at
their invasion (‘vocati sint,’ referring to
that time).

ita, &c. ‘ thus what had been a tribal,
not national name, prevailed gradually ἐ
‘natio ' is the term in common use for
particular peoples or tribes (6. 33,1; 4o,1;
46, 1, &c.>, and is thus contrasted with
‘ gens‚' used of the race as a whole (cp.
6. 14, 3), but the latter term is often used
of separate peoples (6. 27, 3; 30, 2 ; 38,
