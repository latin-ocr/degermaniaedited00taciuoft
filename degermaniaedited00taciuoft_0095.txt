tion ’ (between invited and uninvited) :
cp. ‘notum ignotumque,’ &c. below.
This indiscriminateness of hospitality
is characteristic of ancient civilization‚
and grows out of its circumstances:
without it, travelling would have been
impossible. It can be illustrated abun-
dantly from the Homeric poems, and
from many other sources, and has its
counterpart now in scantily peopled
countries, though in strong contrast to
modern society generally, or to the
Rome of Tacitus.

1. quantum ad, ‘ so far as concerns '
(z‘quantum attinet ad'); so in Agr.
44, 33 H. 5. 10, 3; perhaps taken from
Ov. A. A. 1, 744 (qnantum ad Piri-
thoum ³).

2. abeunti. Such gifts to the guest
on departure, and the asking for thern,
are illustrated from the Nibelungenlied;
the old German name for them is ‘ letzi '
(SS.). Such ξεινήια are constantly men-
tioned in the Homeric poems.

moris: cp. c. 13, 1.

3. facilitas, ‘ freedom from con-
straint ’ : so ‘ facilis ’ is used in the sense
of ‘frank' in Agr. 40, 4; A. 3. 8, 4,
&c.

gaudent, emphatic, as in c. 5, 2.

4. imputant, ‘reckon as a favour.'
The giver expects no return, the receiver
feels no obligation.

vietus inter hospites comis. This
sentence could possibly be taken as sum-
ming up the passage (‘ the whole social
life of guestfriends is courteous’)‚ but
seems so weak and out of place that it
has been generally either bracketed or
altered. Some, by reading ‘ communis ’

tum ad negotia nec minus saepe ad convivia pro-

4. [victus . . . comis] so bracketed
6. statim enirn B b¹.

for ‘comis,' make it a reminiscence of
the ‘ victusque communicatur’ of Caes.
(see above). The ‘ vinculum inter hos-
pites comitas’ of Lachmann (which SS.
adopts) is somewhat violent and hardly
apposite; ‘victus inter honestiores co-
mites ' (Mr.) would give a meaning only
true in special caseS, where a ‘comita-
tus’existed, and it is perhaps best to
regard the sentence as interpolate-d from
a marginal summary of the passage.
The preceding sentence seems to close
the subject.

6. quem plerumque, δία, in con—
trast to the Romans who usually rose
before daybreak.

7. saepius calida. In view of other
statements (as Caes. 4. 1, 103 6. 21, 5:
Herodian, 7. 2, 12) that the Germans'
bath was the river, and the abundant
evidence of their fondness for swimming
(A. 2. 8, 3), it has been thought that
Tacitus is wrong3 but his words may
well be true of the daily ablutions of
most Germans during most part of the
year (⁴ saepius ²). For the use of ‘ut‚'
cp. c. 17, 2.

plurimum, sc. ί temporis' (c. 15, ι).

8. separatae, &cn This also is con-
trary to Roman custom. It has been
thought that the latter part of the state—
ment is an error arising from the use of
the same German words for a table and
a dish (ep. ‘'l'isch ' from Latin 'discus’M
but separate tablcs as well as separate
seats are found used by Greeks in early
times (Od. 17, 333; 22, 74. ἃς.)

9. convivia; besides public. there
were osten family feasts to celebrate
births, marriages, &c
