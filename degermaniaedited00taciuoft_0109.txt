but led to a considerable permanent
extension of the Roman frontier. On
this we have the trustworthy military
evidence of the contemporary Frontinus,
who says of Domitian (Strat. 1. 3, 10),
‘limitibus per centum et viginti milia
passuum actis non mutavit tantum
statum belli sed et subiecit dicioni suae
hostes, quorum refugia nudaverat.’ This
portion is taken to have been in the
Taunus district (see Mommsen, l. l.
p. 150, note), but must have extended
far enough to directly benefit the settlers
in the ‘ agri decumates' by giving them
security so far as they bordered on the
formidable Chatti. 'Where they fronted
the friendly Hermunduri the river seems
to have been as yet the boundary (see
c. 41, 1). It may generally be taken to
be the case that the provincial frontier
in this quarter was, in effect, advanced
under Domitian to the limit which the
completed ‘ limes ⁷ made permanent: by
him, or perhaps earlier, a ce-ntre of
Roman worship, similar to others else-
where (see on A. Ι. 39, 1), was probably
set up at ‘Arae Flaviae ' <R0ttweil, near
the source of the Neckar), and very soon
after Tacitus was writing, a military road
was opened up by Trajan <see Mommsen,
1.1. p. 153), and a beginning may pro-
bably from this time be dated of the
growth in population and trade which
afterwards made the region prosperous
tMarquardt, l. l. p. 278).

provinciae, of Upper Germany, and
also partly of Raetia.

2. habentur,‘ are reckoned ’ (cp. A. 2.
55, 4). The grammatical subject is
‘ii qui . . . exercent’ ; the logical the
lands themselves.

3. hos, The Mattiaci, as well as the
inhabitants of the ‘ decumates agri‚'
seem referred to.

Chatti. On these see Momms. 1. 1. pp.
149-152. They occupied the highland

tract, including the basin of the Eder
and other tributaries of the upper
Weser, where their name survives in the
modern Hessen. They were not known
to Caesar, unless they are his ‘Suebi‚’
but-except during the short supremacy
of Arminius (566 e. 36, 1), they are the
most constant and most powerful
enemies of Rome in Western Germany,
though their action is hampered by their
feuds with their own neighbours the
Cherusci (c. 36, 2, A. 12. 28, 2) and
Hermunduri (A. 13. 57, 1). They had
been lately the object of Domitian's
attack (see on c. 29, 3), and continue to
be heard of until they are absorbed into
the Franks.

initium . . . incohatur. This pleon-
asm is found in Livy, 3. 54, 9; 39. 23,
5, and other similar ones in Tacitus, as
‘initio orto’ (H. 1. 39, 3, &c.) ‘prin-
cipium . . . . inciperet’ (A. 13. 10, 2),
&c- Most recent edd. read ‘ incohant’
or ‘ inchoant.'

Hercynio : see on c. 28, 2. The
part here meant would be on the north
of the Main.

4. effusis, ‘ extending on a level?
‘ extensive’ : cp.‘ effusissimum . . . sinum ’
(Vell. 2. 43, 1).

5. durant, διο. The punctuation and
meaning of this passage are much dis-
puted. It seems best, with Halm, to
make‘ colles' the subject of both verbs.
so that ‘ durant ’ would answer to ‘ pro-
sequitur ’ and ‘rarescunt ' to ‘ deponit.‘
The meaning would thus be, ‘since the
hills last through their territory, gradu-
ally open out (cp. ⁶ rarescent claustra
Pelori‚' Verg. Aen. 3, 411 1, and the Her-
cynian forest conducts its own Chatti to
its 11111115 and sets them down on the
plain' (1.6. they end where the hills
end'). The next best alternative appears
to be that of 7.. , who places a semicolon
before and a comma atter ‘ durant,’ and
then no stop until · rarescunt,' making
‘ Chatti' the subject os the former verb.
