Ἀσκιπύργιον, is generally taken to be a
gloss, as Tacitus always either avoids
Greek words or translates them (cp. A.
3. 65, 3; 15. 71, 3, δία). It is not, how-
ever, clear whether he thought ‘Asci-
burgium ’ a Greek word, or whether it
is right to mark a lacuna where some
old (perhaps Celtic) name of the place
more resembling that of Ulixes has been
lost.

1. quin etiam, often used in ana-
strophe by Tacitus, as by poets (Verg.
Aen. 8, 485, δία).

Ulixi, perhaps best taken as dative of
the agent: cp. ‘ urbes . . . Macedonibus
sitae ² (A. 6. 41, 2). On the other hand,
‘ aram Druso sitam’ (A. 2. 7, 3) is
generally taken differently.

2. monumentaque et tumulos,
hendiadys, ‘barrows with inscriptions.'
Probably the inscriptions were Etruscam
that language being akin to the Raetian
(see on c. 1, 1), and its alphabet from a
Greek source. The name ‘Laertes‚’ if it
could perhaps be placed here, might be
a mistake for the Etruscan title ‘ Lart.’

4. adhuc, in the time of these in-
formants.

neque confirmare, &c., almost ver-
bally from Liv. Praef. 9, ‘ea nec adfir-
mare nec refellere in animo est.'

5. ex ingenio suo, ‘ according to in-
dividual inclination.'

demat, vel addat fidem, explained
by the words above: ‘ fides ' has rather
the meaningof ‘credibility’ than ‘belief.'

7. Ipse, in contrast to ‘ quisque.' He
here carries further what he had said in

c. 2, Ι, and holds them not only to be
autochthonous, and a single raee, but
also to have remained always unmixed,
as is shown by the uniformity of type.
He thus implies disbelief in these tales
of foreign visitors. A supposed mixed
race is noted in c. 46, 1, and on the
whole Tacitus goes too far (see Introd.
p. 16). One of the wives of Ariovistus
was a Norican (Caes. i. 53, 4).

others retain the MSS. text.

8. aliis, probably a various reading
inserted from the margin: some retain
it as a repetition for emphasis: cp.
