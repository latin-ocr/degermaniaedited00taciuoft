In the representation of the character and institutions of the people‚
we have a picture of a race of Aryan speech and institutions at a stage
of development on the whole peculias to itse1f1. The resemblance
that will chiefly strike classical students is that to the Greeks of the
Homeric age 2. Like these, they constantly bear arms in daily life 3,
they show hospitality to the stranger no less than to friends4, they
reckon value in oxen or other animals ⁵, they get their wives by a kind
of purchasess, blood vengeance and its atonement by a ποινή are
recognized institutions7, the kings are honoured by quasi-voluntary
gistsss, the submissior] of great questions, such as war and peace, to
a general assembly of the people, aster previous discussion by the
chiefs⁹‚ reminds us of the Homeric βουλή and ἀγορή ¹⁰, and the
tumultuous spear-clashing by which approval was indicated ¹¹, is but
a variation from the Achaean shoutm.

On the other hand we notice no less striking and instructive
differences. In some respects, especially as regards the arts and
appliances of life, the Germans are at a far lower stage, as we should
expect in a race remote from the Mediterranean, compared with those
Thus, although the)v
were living in an age not of bronze but iron, meta] of all kinds is
scarce with Germans, the iron-tipped ‘framea' is the only universal
weapon, the shield is of mere painted boards‚ the sword and massy
spear and corslet are rare, the helmet in any form almost unknown 13,
a great contrast in all points to the Homeric panoplies. Again, even
the Homeric ship must have been sorne stages removed from the
northern sail-less boats]⁴, and a house far less splendid than the

who had long known Phoenician intercourse.

no doubt the typica] Gauls.
