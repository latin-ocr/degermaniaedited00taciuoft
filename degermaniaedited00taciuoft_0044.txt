28 INTRODUCTION

may have been at some time contested by Donar or Thor1, an
elemental thunder-god, as much less than Zeus as Wuodan is more
than Hermes, or by Tiu or Ziu 2, who, however he may have been
conceived originally, is known later specially as the war-god, even in
this capacity not more such than Wuodan, and retaining little or
nothing of Zeus but the bare name. Another competitor for supremacy
may have been Freyr, the god of fertility, who seems to have been
the chief object of worship with one section of Germans 3, but of whom
Tacitus knows nothing. From the ways in which these conceptions
of deities cross each other, and from the passages in Tacitus where
a single divine ancestor of the race 4 and ruler of all things ⁵ is spoken
of, we seem to recognize a general and perhaps undefined idea of
divinity passing into a mythology adapting itself to the prevalent
worships of different divisions of the race5, and tending to centre in
the supreme god of a dominam section. In some similar fashion the
mysterious goddesses mentioned in three different places ⁷ may all be
brought into harmony with each other and with the theology as
a whole by being regarded as various local forms of the worship of
Earth ὃ, who, besides such attributes as elsewhere attached to her, was
with Germans the special parent of their ancestral god ⁹.

The true German Heracles or Hercules, whose exploits formed the
theme of their battle songsm, in whose sacred grove Arminius gathered
his forces for a decisive battle ¹¹, and a legend of whose pillars seemed
to some to point to his wanderings to the remotest ocean ¹², is generally
supposed to be found in the hero Irmin, whose personality, however,
partakes of the prevalent confusion, whose name appears sometimes
