Vi PREFACE

I have therefore ventured to hope that, by striking
a balance between the meagreness of a schoolbook
and the fulness of an exhaustive edition, I may have
best consulted the requirements of most English
readers, These, while desiring to study this remark-

recent criticism, may probably not care to enter fully
into what is still, and is likely always to continue to
be, obscure and doubtful, or to have more than a very

indication of works in which those who desire further
discussion may find it. ¹

The text adopted is generally that of Halm, but
differs from it in a few places for reasons given in

and the source of the teXt adopted, where it differs
from them; but such further discussion as can be
given of conjectural emendations will be found in the
explanatory notes. The most complete and accurate
collation known to me of the four leading MSS. is
that of Karl Muellenhoff (Berlin, 1873), and where,

best to follow him. Three other MSS, preserved in
Germany‚ are cited from the collation of Alfred
Holder (Leipzig, 1878). -

the new issue of Orelli (Berlin, 1877), the abridged
