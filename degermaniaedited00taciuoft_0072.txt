XYickham's note on Hor. Od. 3. 21, 5,
where ‘ quocunque . . . nomine' has a
somewhat similar meaning, and the
sense is explained as taken from the
headings or titles of an account.

2. puellae . . . nobiles, a better
reading in every way than ‘nubiles'
Only the highborn of either sex would
be of value as hostages (cp. H. 4. 28, 1).
Female hostages are seen in H. 4. 79, 1 ;
such were sometimes required by Au-
gustus xSuet. Aug. 21), and appear in
ancient Roman history, as in the story
of Cloelia xLiv. 2. 13, 63.

3. 1110550, &c The respect felt for
women is illustrated still more strongly.
Besides their faith in prophetesses, Mf.
notes the respect paid to the feminine
ideal in the conception of the female
semideities or ‘idisi’ (sec A. 2. 16, 1),

the advisability os battle.

5. vidimus, probably taken strictly.
From Stat. S. 1. 4, 90 (c captivaeque

was brought a prisoner to Rome, prob-
ably in the time of V espasian, perhaps
in A. D. 70, and may have been seen by
Tacitus and his contemporarieS.

Velaedam. This prophetess, one of
the Bructeri, played an important part
in inspiring the rising of Civilis: see
H. 4. 61, 3, &c. This form of the name
is given in the Histories (according to
Meiser) in all six places in the second
Medicean MS.. a higher authority than
that of our MSS. here. Dio also (67.
5, 3] has Οὐέληδα 01· Βέληδα, but Statius

7. Albrunam. The readings of the
MSS. convey no meaning; the correo

name denoting a gift of witchcraft 01·
prophecy (‘ die mit der Runenkraft der
