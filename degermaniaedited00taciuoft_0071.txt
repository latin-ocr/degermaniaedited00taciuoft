silvis ' (H. 1.1.). The figures were no
doubt hung on sacred trees.

ferunt3 the subject Τ as of ζ(3161121119)
is probably general.

quodque, appositional relative, re-
ferring to the following clause.

2. turmam aut cuneum, ‘ a division
of horse or foot': on the latter, see c. 6, 5.

familiae et propinquitates, i. e.
families and clans fought together. In-
stances of this are cited in later German
warfare. Caesar states (6. 22, 2) that
the allotments of land (on which see
c. 26,1)‚ followed a similar principle:

‘gentibus cognationibusque hominum,
qui una coierint, quantum, et quo loco
visum est, agri adtribuunt!

3. et in proximo, &c. The women
and children were thus brought into the
field by Civilis (H. 4. 18, 4), 211(1 by
Ariovistus (Caes. 1. 51, 6), also by Thra-
cians (A. 4. 51, 2), and Britons (A. 14.
34, 4). The wives of the Teutons are
represented as even slaying their own
warriors in their flight (Plut. Mar. 19).

pignora; often so used for ‘pignora
amoris' (Agr. 38, 1; A. 12. 2‚1,&c.),
after poets (Prop. ΟΥ. 810.) 211(1 Livy.

unde . . . audiri. Although the his-
torical infinitive is used by Tacitus in
dependent clauses, as with ·' cum' (A.
2. 31, 1, 810), ‘ ubi’ (A. 6.19‚ 4, &c.)‚
‘donec (A. 13. 57, 6), there is no pre-
cedent for its use to express what is
customary (see Drager, Synt. und Stil
des Tacitus ἐξ 28(1; 172), 1101 is the
‘ hinc exaudiri ’ ofVerg. Aen. 7, 15 (cited
by Z. ), truly parallel. Ritt. brackets
‘ audiri‚’ others would insert ‘ potest ' or

aut B b¹.

3. ululatus foeminarum C.
et C c, aut Β b.

‘possit,’ or read ‘auditur,' *audiasss or
‘ audire est.’ The two latter are prefer-
able to the first, as ‘ ululatus' is probably
plural (A. 4. 62, 5 ; 14. 32, 2).

4. hi, the wives and mothers, supplied
from the sense. The gender is attracted
to that of ‘testes ’ and ‘laudatores‘

5. ferunt, i. e. come and show them.

6. exigere, ‘to examine' (i. e. to com-
pare, and assign the palm of honourj:
so in Liv. Sen. Quint. The sense ‘re-
quire' or ‘demand' hardly suits ζ pavent?
SS'2. thinks it possible that we have here
an exaggeration (for contrast with Ro-
man ladies) of the fact that the women
acted as surgeons.

cibosque, &c., a zeugma for ‘cibos
apportant et ad virtutem hortantur.'
Tacitus often thus joins material and
mental ideas: cp. ‘ metu aut montibus’
(c. 1, 1). The frequentative ‘gestant’
expresses regular practice.

8. Memoriae proditur. The tense
would imply that he is citing a still
living oral tradition, containing prob-
ably no reference to the cases 1100th on
e. 7, 3.

inclinatas, ‘turned in flight': so in
Liv. and intrans. act. in A. 1. 64, 4; H.
3. 83, 1.

9. obiectu pectorum. Some take
this as ‘ sc ipsas periculis pugnae obici-
endo '; but the context would rather
suggest that it is a gesture imploring
their husbands to kill thcm rather than
let them become slaves.

10. monstrata comminus captivi-
tate, ‘ signisying (by word and gestures
the captivity close awaiting them ’z sor
