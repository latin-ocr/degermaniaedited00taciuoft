(67. 5, 2) has Λύγιοι (whence some
here read ‘Lygiorum'), and the Med.
MS. of Tacitus in A. 12. 29, 3, ‘ligii‚'
which is perhaps intended by MSS.
here. The name has been suggested
to mean ‘dwellers in woodland' (or
marshland), but is quite uncertain.
Of the separate names given here little
or nothing is known. The Helvecones
should perhaps be ‘Helvaeones‚' the
Αἷλουαίωνες of Ptol. (2.11. 7), whojoins
them with the Βούργουντες (⁴ Burgo-
diones ' of plin), i. e. the Burgundians‚
of whom Tacitus knows nothing, but
who, with the Vandals, appear to be
the later representatives of these Lugian
tribes. Some, however, as Latham‚
consider the Lugians to be Slavs, and
ancestors of the PoleS.

3. antiquae religionis, ‘ of an an-
cient worship ’ ; ‘ religioni ’ is supplied
with ‘praesidet.’ The worship was
probably common to all these Lugian
tribes, and the deities were probably
conceived as ancestors of the raee (as

. in c. 40, 2).

4. muliebri ornatu. Mf. considers
that this is to be understood of the hair
only, and that the priest was one of
the ‘ Hazdinge' (‘men with women's
hair ³), known later as the Vandal royal
race.

sed. The point of contrast seems to
be that the gods are male.

5. Castorem Pollucemque. This
Roman interpretation appears to be
quite correct, the worship of the Dio-
scuri being in some form a very general
cult, appearing also in the Scandinavian

mythology under the names of Baldr
and Vali, and in the Alemannic under
those of Baltram and Sintram, and else-
where of other hero brothers and trace-
able also among Slavs‚ Celts, and
Indians. The worship is noted as suit-
able to a race of horsemen, such as
were the later Vandals.

vis, ‘the attributes? ⁵ numini‚’ ‘their
divinity.’

6. Alcis. None of the pairs of hero
brothers mentioned above bear any -
such name, and its form and meaning
are much disputed. It has been gene-
rally taken as dat. (cp. ‘ maioribus
minoribusque' c. 34, Ι), from a form
⁶ Aleae ’ or ‘ Alci,' but the nominative
is certainly the usual ease in Tacitus sor
substantives in such expressions (see
Nipp. on A. 2. 16, Ι), which would
suggest such a form as ‘Alceis,' or
that ‘ Alces ’ or ‘ Alei ’ should be read.
Some would connect the word with ἀργός
(‘bright’)‚ others with ἄλκη. Holz-
mann thinks it traceable in names like
⁵ Alcuin.'

peregrinae, ‘ non German ’ (e. 9, 2),

shown by imageS, &c.

7. ut fratres . . . ut iuvenes, i. e.
though there are no images, all the
ideas of the worship arc personal.

9. truces, taken with ‘ super vires ' :
fierce as they are (i. e. having an ‘insita
feritas '), besides having a strength su-
perior to other Lugians.

arte ao tempore, referring to the
black shields, &c.‚ and the night march.
