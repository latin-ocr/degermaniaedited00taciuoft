tion after asyndeta here introduces a
characteristic of a different kind and
greater importance.

1. Suionum. This name, connected
through intermediate forms with that
of ‘ Swede,' is here a general name sor
all the Germanic peoples ofScandinavia.
They are view-ed as consisting of many
subdivisions ‘g‘ civitates'), but as Ger-
mans (cp. ‘ceteros Germanos ' ξ 4) and
Suebian (c. 46, Ι).

hinc, looking from the coast of the
Rugii and Lemovii.

ipso in Oceano, in the midst of it,
as islands: some prefer the reading
‘ ipsae' (i. e. by themselves). Pliny
speaks (4. 13, 27, 96) of ‘Scatinavia’
as a great island of unknown size, and
Ptol. (⁵2. 11, 34) Of the Σκανδῖαι as one
large and three small islands‚ and a
similar opinion was prevalent for some
time later.

praeter: cp. c. 2, 2.

3. utrimque, attributive with‘ prora'
(Nep. c. 8, 1, &c.): ‘their double prow
presents a front,' &o Such vessels
were employed by Germanicus (A. 2.
6, 2), and were in use among other
nations (cp. H. 3. 47, 53 Plin. 6. 22,
24, 82), and such still survive in coast
districts of Sweden. A large boat of
this form, belonging to the iron age,
and found in a peat bog in Jutland‚ is
figured and described in Green, Illus-
trated Hist. of Eng. i. 11.

adpulsui, ‘ for putting to land ' ; so
‘ adpellere‘ in A. and H. l. 1.

4. ministrant. Most recent edd.
adopt this reading as a probable re-
miniscence of Vergil, Aen. 6, 307 ; 10,
218, where the question is still left open

{see Conington's note> whether ‘ velis ”
is dat. of the thing served‚ or abl. in
strum. ‘as it would clearly be here with
the MSS. text ‘ministrantur’). Cp. the
combination of both in H. 1. 48, 5
(⁶ Vinio fictilibus ministrari iubet ⁷).

in ordinem, ‘ so as to form a regular
row.’

5. solutum, ‘the oars are loose‚' so
as to be shifted easily, not secured to
the boat.

quibusdam fluminum = ‘quibus-
dam fluminibus’ (cp. c. 43, 2, 6).

ut res poscit: cp. e. 35, 4, ἃς.

6. est . . . et opibus honos. ‘these
people pay respect even to wealth,' in
contrast to what is said of Germans
generally (c. 5, 2-4).

7. eoque unus imperitat, i.e. be-
cause he is preeminently rich. The
king's power seems really to have rested
on a religious ground (see note below),
and his wealth was probably rather
effect than cause.

nullis iam exceptionibus, ‘here
with no reservations,' such as are noted
in c. 7, 1—23 11, 5; and even in c. 441.

non precario, &c.‚ ‘with a claim
to obedience not merely on sufferance’:
so ‘precarium . . . imperiurn' (H. 1.
52, 6), and the adv. in Agr. 16. 5.
⁸ Iure parendi ' appears to have a strained
meaning (ί the right to be obeyed‘).
and I’assow would read ‘imperandi'
SS gives the view of a Swedish his<
torian, that the Scandinavian royal
power was not really unlimited, but
might seem so to an outsidcr‚ being
enhanced by the idea of divine descent.
and by a hereditary priesthood. The
