name of ‘ Germani ⁷ only at a comparatively recent date ¹. The grounds
of his belief in the indigenous origin of the Germans may seem weak,
and his view of primitive migration as exclusively maritime is limited,
in spite of some contrary evidence that should have occurred to him ²,
by Greek or Roman ideas and the traditions of Mediterranean
peoples3 but it should be noted that the view that the origin of the
Aryans is to be sought not in Asia but in Europe 3, and that several
races‚ and among them the Germans, have existed in situ from a very
remote prehistoric period, and may have acquired kindred languages
by other means than a common origin, has been gaining ground
steadily of late years, and is now, to say the least, very strongly sup-
ported 4. But that any race should have preserved itself‚ as he
conceives that the Germans had, free from any admixture of foreign
blood, is difficult to suppose, not only by reason of the probability of
prehistoric intermingling of races, but also from the constant existence
in historic times of a slave population, often of foreign extraction 5,
growing up‘with the free, and often by enfranchisement becoming
blended with it.

The whole race are plainly viewed by Tacitus as speaking a
common languagess, and as distinguished by it from some other
peoples dwelling among them ⁷. With this language, we should not
suppose that he had any personal acquaintance, nor do his informants
appear to have told him whether there were then any linguistic
differences answering to that between German and Scandinavian, or
between High and Low German 3.

¹ The account of this is extremely
obscure (see c. 2, 5, and note), but it
would certainly appear that the name
was originally assumed by a few tribes
who had invaded Gaul and was gradually
extended. For other cases of local or
triba] names becoming national, we may
instance that of the Hellenes in early
times, the Graeci in the Roman period,
and the present French name Allemagne.

Gauls into Italy, as related in Livy, 5.

³ This opinion appears to have been
first advanced, or at least first brought
into notice, in Dr. Latham's edition of
this treatise, in 1851.

history and present state of this great

question, see Dr. Isaac Taylor’s Origin
of the Aryans.

ὃ There would be, no doubt, among
them captives in war from all Πείξῌ-
bouring peoples, at one time even many
Romans from the army ofVarus (A. 12,
27, 4). It is possible, however, that
the offspring of such mixed blood may
have tended to revert to the prevalent
type.

distinguished from other Germans by
some dialectic differences, but Tacitus
only marks them off by a mode of wear-
