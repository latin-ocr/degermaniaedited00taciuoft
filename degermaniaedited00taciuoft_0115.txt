name is rightly taken to mean ‘dwellers
on the Hase' (an eastern tributary of
the Ems), their district would mainly
coincide with parts of Oldenburg and
Osnabriick.

1. cludunt, a form sometimes used
by Tacitus (e. g. c. 45, 1, 6), Quint„
&c.‚ not in Cic.

aliae gentes, perhaps the Tubantes
of A. 1. 51, 4, and others filling the
place of the Sugambri, who had been
taken across the Rhine.

haud perinde memoratae, perhaps
not here ‘less spoken of‘ (as those
already mentioned do not seem to be
famous), but ‘not much spoken of'
(cp. c· 5, 3)-

a fronte, like ‘a terg0‚' from the
Roman point of view, looking from the
Rhine, i. e. on the west.

2. Frisii. These lived always be-
tween the Yssel and the lower Ems,
and their name is still preserved in that
of Friesland. The distinction into
‘maiores’ and ‘minores' (found here
alone), may coincide with that of Frisii
and Frisiabones in Plin. 4. 15, 29, 101.
They are first known as subdued by
Drusus, and as in dependence on Rome
till their revolt in A.D. 28 (A. 4. 72, 1),
then as again reduced by Corbulo in
A.D. 47 (A. 11. 19, Ι), and as having
joined the revolt of Civilis (H. 4. 15.
4; 79, 35. It is probable (see A. 13,
54) that the eastern portion, coinciding
with one of the divisions above given,
retained its independence (see Momms.
v. E. T. i. 126, note).

excipiunt, ‘follow on,’ come next
to.

3. ex modo, ‘according to the mea-
sure of.'

4. praetexuntur, ‘are bordered.'
Z. notes the similar geographical use

H

in Plin. 6. 25, 29, 112, ‘montes .. . qui
omnes has gentes praetexunt.'

ambiunt, ‘ dwell around.'

insuper, besides the Rhine bank.
The lakes (cp. A. 1, 60, 3, &c.) com-
prise Lake Flevo and others, merged
in the Zuyder Zee since the end of the
thirteenth century.

et, explanatory (⁵ those which have
been').

5. Romanis elassibus, dat. of agent
(cp. c. 16, 1, &e.): those of Drusus in
B.C. 12, and of Germanicus in A.D. 15,
16, are especially meant.

6. illa, ‘in that quarter' (cp. H. 3,
8, 3; 5. 18, 33 A. 2. 17, 6). The
chief voyages along the coast of the
North Sea were those of Drusus and
Tiberius (see 011 c. 1, 1), and those of
Germanicus to the mouth ofthe Ems and
back (see A. 1. 60, 3; 70, 13 2. 23—24 .

superesse, ‘ remained to be ex-
plored.'

Hereuh's columnas. At a later
date there is a record (see Grimm,
Mythol. E. T. i. 115 foll.) of idols in
Germany called ‘Irminsfilij apparently
columns surmounted by a head, like
the Athenian Hermae. The word is
taken by Grimm to mean no more than
‘ huge pillars‚' but would no doubt be
popularly supposed to mean ⁶ pillars of
Irmin‚’ who is taken to be the German
Hercules (see Introd. p. 28). It is
tempting to suppose in this passage
some vague reference to a traveller’s tale
ossuch columns, but it is equallypossible
that the belief here mentioned has no
definite basis. It would be natural to
imagine something in the distant north,
answering to the well-known Calpe
and Abyla3 and Wuodan as a wan-
derer might answer no less to Hercules

than to Ulysses (see Introd. pp. 27, 29 ’.
