equorum pecorumque: on these
as a medium of exchange, see note on
6. 5, 2.

1. regi vel civitati. The latter
term applies to states without kings.
This payment was in recognition of the
breaeh of the peace.

2. vel propinquis. This would be
the case when the injured person had
been killed (c. 21, 1).

eliguntur, &c., ‘ in the same assem-
blies are chosen those presidents who
decide suits in districts and villages.’
Cp. ⁶ principes regionum atque pagorum
inter suos ius dicunt (Caes. 6. 23, 5), and
on the whole subject of these magis—
trates or ‘ealdormen,' see Introd. pp.
21, 25. ΟΠ the German ⁶ pagi' and ‘vici'
see Id. ⁷p. 22, foll. From the mention
of ⁴ centeni comites’ below, it has been
thought that here, as perhaps also in
6. 6, 5, and also in the mention of the
‘centum pagi' of the Semnones (c. 39,
4), some account of an already existing
institution of ‘ hundreds ' has been mis-
understood by Tacitus or his informants ;
that the ‘pagus' was the ‘hundred‚'
that its ⁴ princeps' had some title derived
from his office,' and that his assessors
were in some way representative of the
body, or possibly not one hundred
persons, but the ⁴ eoncilium' of the
‘hundred' as such, i. e. all its fully
qualified menibers. On this and other
views, see ὃὸ, SS'3„ Z„ and Introd. p. 23.

3. iurareddunt: cp. A. 6. 11, 13 12.
43, 2; 13. 51. 1. Some would read
‘1·eddant,’ which would mean that they
were appointed for this purpose.

4. consilium simul et auctoritas,

‘ as advisers and with power to decide?
Their yerdict was binding on the presi-
dent, as that of Roman ‘iudices ² on the
praetor.

6. Nihil autem, &c. The conjunc—
tion connects the thought with the ‘con—
sidunt armati ’ of 6. 11, 4, and the
remark here leads naturally to the fol-
lowing subject. The use of arms in
daily life is noticed also among the
Celts (Posidonius in Ath. 4. 40, 154),
and the Homeric Greeks (cp. Thuc. 1.
6, 1).

7. arma sumere, analogous to ⁵ to-
gam virilem sumere.’ In later times
German youths were invested with the
sword, as here with shield and spear.

moris (sc. ‘est'), so in 6. 21, 3, &c.
for ⁶ mos est ' : for the use of the genit.
cp. 6. 6, 6.

8. civitas, ‘the community,' as in
6. 8, 1; 10, 4.

suffecturum, ‘as likely to be corn·
petent '; so used with dat. of the thing
(H. 4. 8, 2, &e.), for which ‘ armis’ is
here supplied.

9. vel principum aliquis, &c. This
would naturally mean one of the magis·
trates, or ‘ ealdormen’ (c. 12, 3), and it
is best so to take the term throughout
these two chapters, and to suppose that
all such could have a ‘ comitatus.' Taci-
tus appears to mean that, ordinarily
speaking, the youth was admitted to
bear arms by his father, or, in case of
his death, by the nearest relations, but
that sometimes he was admitted by a
‘ princeps'; this being a special dis-
tinction and (according to the best view
of the passage below) carrying with it
