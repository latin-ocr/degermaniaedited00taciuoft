CAP. 31—33. 95

time (cp. Agr. 28, 1, and note). See
Momms. v. E. T. p. 151, note. Tacitus
avoids mentioning this, and gives their
mere name only.

Tencteri: so now read for ‘ Tenc-
theri ’ in Caes. 4. 1, 1, &c. They appear

to have shared the earlier movements of

the Usipi (see Mf. cited by SS².)‚ and to
have lived at this time above the Ruhr
along the Rhine‚ nearly opposite to
the Ubii (H. 4. 64, 1), and extending
upwards to the Lahn ε they were after-
wards absorbed into the Alemanni.

colunt, i. e. ‘ripam eius accolunt’
(cp. c. 28, 4).

1. solitum, that of Germans gener-
ally.

equestris disciplinae arte, ‘in
skill of horsemanship.'

2. Tencteris, varied to dative in-
stead of repeating ‘apud'

3. hi, ‘of this kind,’ referring to
‘ equestris disciplinae a1·s.’

5. inter, &c., ‘as part of the do-
mestic establishment and household
chattels, and subjects os rightful in·
heritance' (‘penates’ as in c. 15, 1,
&c.).

6. exeipit, ‘succeeds to them' (cp.
c. 34, 1 ; Agr. 14, 3). There is some
inconsistency with ‘traduntur,' as the
horses are said not to have passed by
general 1·ule; but Tacitus seems only
to mean by it that they were kept in
the family and inherited by one of its
members. ·

maximus na‘m. This has caused a
difficulty, as a law or eustom of primo-
geniture is not generally found among
early Germans (cp. c. 20, 5). Tacitus
may mean to note it as peculiar to the
Tencteri, or perhaps to speak of the

eldest son as the one on whom the whole
estate devolved, and who had to dis—
tribute it. See note in SS2.

prout, &c., i. e. the one who is most
so.

7. bello, repeated with ‘melior':
cp. ‘ferox bello' (Hor. Od. 1. 32, 6),
and the frequent use of ‘ferox’ and
‘ ferocia' in a good sense (Agr. 27, 1 3
31, 43 H. 1. 51, 1, &c.).

S. quta: 1. e. in their rear further
from the river. They more strictly
bordered on the Usipi.

Bructeri. These are found among
the enemies of Varus (A. 1. 60, 4) and
of Germanicus (A. 1. 51, 4, 8116..) They
lived near the sources of the Ems and
Lippe, and on both banks of the middle
Ems (Momms. 1.1. p. 145), and were
occupying this district in A.D. 58 (A.
13. 56, 4), and were important enemies
in 70, when their prophetess Velaeda
(see c. 8, 3) was influential. Strabo
and Ptol. distinguish them into ‘mi-
nores ' and ‘ maiores.'

9. Chamavos. These are found
earlier near the lower Rhine (A. 13. 55,
5); their name appears to survive in
that of the mediaeval district Hama-
land, near Miinster. The termination,
like that of ‘Batavh’ appears to be
Celtic. Some have identified them
with the ‘Bructeri maiores,' and sup—
posed the struggle here mentioned to
have been a civil war.

Angrivarios. These are found in
Α.1). 16 on the middle Weser, bordering
on the Cherusci (A. 2. 19, 3‘, and are
thought by Mf. to be closely related to,
or perhaps confused with, the Ampsi-
varii ofA. 13. 55 1. (irimm takes the

name to mean ‘dwellers in meadows ’
