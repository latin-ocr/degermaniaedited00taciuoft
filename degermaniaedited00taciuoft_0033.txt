and adornment among the dwellings of even princely Germans ².

To Set against these, there are points in which the Germans had
reached a considerably higher stage. The sense of liberty and
personal dignit), by no means prominent in the Homeric &fipofss is
here fully developed: the German comes to assemblies as and when
he pleases, is unmistakably free to disapprove as well as to approve,
and has rather to be persuaded than coerced ⁴, and the king is hardly
more prominent in it than others whose position or achievements
entitle them to be heard.

On the German king we would gladly have heard more from
Tacitus·'¹. We gather that he was chosen, but only from the noblest
lineage ὓ, the ‘stirps regia ζ’ generally represented as of divine descent.
in the full sense διογενής. But, however approaching to a despotic
monarch in the most remote and backward tribes ⁸, he has elsewhere
more dignity than power. It is even doubtful whether he is necessarily
the leader in war ⁰, and certainly the supreme coercive authority both
in the field and in the assembly belongs not to him but to the priest1‘z
He has a faint survival of primitive priestly function in augury ¹¹, he
has a share of fines ¹², and probably of other presents ¹³³, but does not
appoint judges or 1nagistrates1⁴, and generally reigns rather than
governs; while any such royalty as that of MaroboduuS, embracing
many tribes, and almost confronting the Caesar as an equal, was
most abnormal and obnoxious to the sentiment of independence¹⁵.
Again, even such limited kingly rule, though prevalent among the
Suebic Germansffi, is represented as generally dispensed with among
the western and more advaneed t1·ibes¹⁷, and replaced by the rule os
an elected magistrate ¹³³, or probably in more cases by no other central
