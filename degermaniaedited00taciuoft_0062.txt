connected it with the Gallie ‘ bardi ’
(on whom see Lucan, Ι, 444ἶ. Τ11056
who read ‘ baritus' cite the use of ‘bar-
ritus' in Ammianus and Vegetius (e. g.
‘ voce Martia concinentes, quem appel·
lant barritum,’ Amm. 31. 7, 11‘) of a
war-cry of this character.

2. augurantur. It is to be gathered
from the context that certain character-
istics of the sound by itself (ipso cantu]
otherthan mere loudness wereinterpreted
according to rules of augury.

sonuit acies, so in H. 4. 18, 5.

3. vocis . . . videtur. This reading
is adopted by most recent edd. ‘ The
unison seems one of valour rather than
of mere sound? The expression seems
suggested by ‘melior actionum quam
sonorum concentus' (Cic. Off. 1. 40,
145). The MSS. text may be taken (with
CB) to mean ‘ these shouts do not so
much seem articulate sounds as a general
cry of valour.’

4. fractum, so used of sounds by
Vergil (G. 4, 723 Aen. 3, 556), where
some explain it of the intermittent or
successive, others of the crashing char—
acter of trumpet blasts or wave sounds.
The latter passage is the more apposite,
as Ammianus 16. 12, 43) describes the
‘ barritus ² as ‘ clamor . . . a tenui susurro
exoriens paulatimque adulescens ritu . . .
fluctuum cautibus illisorum.'

6. ceterum et, going back to ⁶ me-
morant,’ but citingfrom other authorities.
He here obviously refers to Greek or
Roman antiquaries, following German
or Celtic legends of a wandering god or

hero, and fixing them to a spot by some
local beliefs or resemblance of names.
Many such extensions of the Odysseus
myth are noted, bringing him to Iberia,
Caledonia. Lusitania, &o The German
wanderer is probably Wuodan ; see
Introd. p. 27.

opinantur. This verb is used by
Tacitus only here and four times in
Dial.

Ulixen. This name, corrupted into
‘Ulysses‚' represents the form in which
Odysseus was known to the Sicilian
Greeks, and through them to the
Romans.

7. fabuloso, ‘rich in legend’: cp.
‘ fabulosus Hydaspes’ (Hor. Od. Ι. 22,
8) ; it is used differently in 6. 46, 6.

huno, i.e. the German. The writer
as it were transports himself to the spot.

S. Asciburgium, mentioned in H.
4. 33, I, and evidently not far from
Vetera; generally taken to be Asburg,
near the Rhine‚ and near Moers; but
by some to be Essenburg, near Duisburg.
The name is German (‘ship station,'
from ‘Esche ' = ‘ ash ⁹), and may have
been given by the Cugerni (H. 4. 26, 4),
who had dispossessed the Menapians
(Caes, 4. 4). Professor Rhys (Hibbert
Lectures, p. 289) inclines to connect it
with the myth of the man named ‘Ash'
created by Wuodan (see on 6. 2, 3).

situm, sc. ‘ est 'z some prefer to make
it a participle, and to take ‘hodieque'
as ‘hodie quoque‚’ as in Vell. Ι. 4, 2,
3, &c.
