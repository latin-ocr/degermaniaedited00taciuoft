and ‘ colles ' of the latter 3 i. e. the Chatti
begin within the mountain range, extend
eontinuously as it opens out, and end
where it ends. For other views see
88²„ K.. and C. B. Others would
adopt the v. l. ‘durans’ (referred to
‘initium ²), or read ‘durantes' (with
‘ colles ’). Pramm. strikes out ‘ durant '
altogether. Tacitus would appear in
any case to mean that the Chatti ex-
tended to the plain of north Germany,
which is incorrect.

1. prosequitur . . . . deponit : for
such personifications cp. ‘ bellum ape-
ruit ' (61, 1), ‘caespes erigit’ (c. 27, 2),
and others noted in Introd. p. 1 1.

2. simul atque, here equivalent to

’‘et' . . . ‘et't‘cp. c.12,3; 31, 4.

stricti, ‘close knit ’ (C. R), sinewy.

3. et, adding a mental quality to the
physical traits denoted by the asyndeta.

animi vigor, ‘ activity of mind ’ : cp.
Liv. 9. 16, 12.

ut inter Germanos (qualifying
‘multum ’>, ‘ as the standard is among
Germans ’ ; so ‘ magno ut inter barbaros
praelio ' (as read by Halm in A. 11·. 17,
,τηε in 6. 2, 43 22, 2, the meaning is
different.

4. rationis, ‘method ’ς the histori-
cal infinitivts which follow are epexe-
getical nominatives in apposition.

praeponere eleetos. This is gener-
ally taken to mean that they had no
hereditary rulers (566 Introd. p. 19, note
17, : possibly the stress is on ‘clectos.'
They choose leaders caresully, and obey
them g‘audire'). Germans in general
did not obey the command of their

8. ratione c b2, τῶ C, Romanae B b¹.

leaders, but followed their example (c.
7, Ι), .,

5. nosse ordines, ‘ know their place
in the ranks,' like a Roman soldier in
his century. The Germans had an order
of battle (e. 6, 5), but less exact.

intellegere occasioneS, ‘to notice
(not overlook) opportunities': ep.‘terga
occasioni patefecit’ (Agr. 14, 4).

differre, ⁴ reserve for the right
moment?

6. disponere diem, ‘to map out the
day’ (have regular hours for different
duties) ; so in Sen. Cons. ad Pol. 6,
4; Pl. Ep. 9. 36, 1 ; Suet. Tib. 11.

vallare noctem: ‘noctu castra val-
lare ⁹ (make night safe by defences),
a strained attempt at concise antithesis
to ‘ disponere diem.5 Cp. Introd. p. 9.

fortunam, &c., i.e. not to reckon on
luck.

8. concessum, ‘granted by the fa-
vour of heaven,’ a grandiloquent exag-
geration suited to Roman pride. Some
have adopted the reading ‘ratione dis-
ciplinae ‘ (‘ by a system of discipline ').

plus reponere, more fully ‘ plus spei
repositum' (Livy, 2. 39, Ι).

9. omne robur, somewhat stronger
than what is said of the Germans gener-
ally in c. 6, 4: cp. c. 32, 2.

super, ‘besides,’ a sense frequent in
and after Livy.

ferramentis, ‘ tools,’ as spades, axes,
mattocks‚ &c.

10. copiis, ‘ provisions ' (H. 2. 32, 3,
&c.).

ad proelium . . . ad bellum; ‘to
fight a battle ’ . . . ‘to carry on- a carn-
