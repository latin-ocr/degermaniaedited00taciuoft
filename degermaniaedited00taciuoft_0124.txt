Semones
3. patrium

1. Semnones (with long penult. in
Strabo, short in Ptol. and Dio.). These
are mentioned as Suebic in A. 2. 45, 1 z
they are not-known to Caesar, unless
they are his ‘Suebi' (see on e. 38, Ι),
but known as a μέγα ἔθνος of the Suebi
to Strabo [7. Ι, 3, 290), and were among
those who made overtures to Augustus
(Mon. Anc. v. 16: see on c. 37, Ι).
Another of their kings paid court to
Domitian (Dio, 67. 5, 3), and they are
last heard of under this name in the
Marcomanic war (id. 71. 20, 2). Ptol.
places thern on a Σούηβος ποταμός (per-
haps the Oder), and their district at this
time seems to be between the middle
Elbe and Oder in parts of Saxony,
Brandenburg, and Silesia.

2. memorant : with this text (Halm,
SS'2.,Mr.) the subject is general, referring
to authorities as such (cp. c. 3, 1 ; 43,
4) : other edd. follow the well-supported
reading ‘ vetustissimos se.'

fides, ‘credibility' ι cp. c, 57, Ι.

religione, ‘a religious institution?
The fact that this worship was held in
their territory confirms the tradition of
their antiquity.

stato tempore, ‘at a fixed time‚'
thought by Grimm to be about the
autumnal equinox.

3. silvam. On such sacred groves,
cp. c. 9. 3, and note.

auguriis, &c., ‘ hallowed by the
dedicatory rites of ancestors and by
ancient reverence.’ The hexameter is
more noteworthy than others found in
Tacitus, and the diction makes it possible
that it: is a reminiscence of some poet,

who was himself indebted to Verg. G. 4.
468; Aen. 7, 172; 8, 598.

4. eiusdem sanguinis, hardly all
the Suebi, as Tacitus conceives them,
but more than the Semnones them-
selveS, probably all who were called
Herminones (see below). Such common
worships (cp. c. 40, 23 43, 4; A. 1. 5¹-
2) were the only bond of union for the
‘ Stamm ' (see Introd. p. 24).

legationibUS, abl. of means.

caeso, aoristic, as also ‘vectam’ (e.
40, 3); ‘publice' ‘in common ' (c. 15, 3).

5. primordia,‘initiatory rites 'z ‘bar-
bari ⁹ is explained by ‘ horrenda': for
their human sacrifices, cp. e. 9, 1, and
note.

6. vinculo, ‘ a cord ' *gsimilar in idea
to the ring of c. 31, 3). An old name
for this is ‘ simo,’ whence Mf. thinks the
name of this people may be derived.

7. minor, ‘ a subjeet‚’ of the god.

prae se ferens, ‘ outwardly acknow-
ledging.'

8. attolli, in middle sense, as is also
‘ evolvuntur ’3 they must not get up, but
roll themselves away : ‘ advolvi ’ is
similarly used in A. 1. 13, 7.

9. eo, explained by ‘ tamquam? &o

omnis superstitio, ‘ this whole
fanaticism.' Tacitus uses this term of
all barbaric religions, in fact of all
save Greek and Romam so of Christi-
anity (A. 15. 44, 4), Judaism (H. 2. 4,
5), Druidism (Agr. 11, 4).

respicit, tamquam: ep. e. 12, 2:
‘ sint ³ is supplied, as in c. 13, 3, &c.

10. initia gentis, apparently with
reference to the legend given in c. 2, 3.
