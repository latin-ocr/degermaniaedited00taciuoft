66 CORNELI] TACITJ DE GERMANJA

plus per otium transigunt, dediti somno ciboque, fortissimus
quisqu'e ac bellicosissimus nihil agens, delegata domus et
penatium et agrorum cura feminis senibusque et infirmissimo
cuique ex familia : ipsi hebent, mira diversitate naturae, cum

. idem homines sic ament inertiam et oderint quietem.

est civitatibus ultro ac viritim conferre principibus vel armenss
torum vel frugum, quod· pro honore acceptum etiam neces-

sitatibus subvenit.

‘comitatus' leads him to describe the
mode of life generally.

non multum (se. ‘temporis,’ cp. c.
22, Ι). This statement is in direct and
probably intentional contrast to Caes. 6.
21, 3 (‘ vita omnis in venationibus atque
in studiis rei militaris consistit 7),
contrary also to later German record,
to the evidence of old laws, and to that
suggested by the abundance of wild
game in the sorests [Caes. 6. 25, 5, fons:
also ‘fera ⁷ is mentioned as an article of
food below (c. 23, 1). It may yet be
true that the great hunts were occasional
and confined to princes and to those
who lived near forests, and that the
usual life of ordinary freemen in most
parts may have been such as is here
described. Some have followed Lips.
in the violent remedy of striking out
‘non.

1. dediti, &c., a reminiscence of
Sall. Cat. 2, 8 (‘(lediti ventri atque
somno ²).

fortissimus, &c. in apposition to
·dediti.' The whole passage is some·
what disjointed, and differently stopped
by edd. Some make ‘ fortissimus,’ &c.‚
repeated in ⁴ ipsi,' the subject of ‘hebent.'

2. delegata . . . cura, best taken as
abl. abs.

3. penatium, in a sense borrowed
from Roman ideas, ·' hearth and home'
(cp. c. 25, 1; 32, 4; 46, 3), domestic
regulation as distinct from housework
[‘domus’: cp. c. 25, 1).

4, familia, not here as in c. 25, 1,
but of members of the family generally
(c- 7, 5)-

ipsi, ‘the masters?

hebent: cp. ‘torpeat' (c. 14, 3),

‘torpor' (c. 46, 1), and the adj. ‘hebes
ad sustinendum laborem’ (H. 2. 99,
2) ; also ‘ sanguis hebet ’ (Verg. Aen. 5,

mira diversitate. The abl. may be
taken as causal, or as an abl. abs. with
the sense of a participle of ‘esse'
supplied. The reaction noticed is
common to many or most rude races.

5. inertiam, ‘ indolence,' in contrast
to ‘ quietem ' (⁶ peace with others ’).

mos est, δερ. The gifts from the
German people to their princes (here
apparently the magistrates of the state,
including kings where they existed) are
in idea voluntary <‘ultro ’”, but pass in
later times into a customary and thence
compulsory tribute. Cp. the Homerie
θέμιστες (Il. 9, 156). Bp. Stubbs (p.
25) traces to these gifts the ‘ naturalia’
of the Frankish kings.

6. viritim, ‘severally,' each man
contributing his share.

armentorum . . . frugum. The use
of a partitive genit. without some* such
word as ‘ aliquid ' (c. 18, 2ᾗ, is unusual
in Latin, but supported by SS. from
Varr. R. 3, 46 <⁶ apponendum bene
olentium herbarum ⁹) and Appul. Met.
5 (‘auri vel monilium dare ²), and is
regular and common in Greek. It is
somewhat sostened by the following
‘quodff

7. pro honore, ‘ as a gift of honour' :
cp. c. 13, 1.

9. sed. et, so used in c. 35, 2; H. 1. 15,
3 ; A 14. 39, 1, sor the usual ‘ sed etiam!
Haupt follows C. &c. in omitting ‘et '
(cp. c. 10, 5).

publice, ‘ by states as such' ; cp.
H. 1. 51, 63 A. 4. 36, 2, &c.
