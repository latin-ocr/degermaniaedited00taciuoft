CORNELII TA css] DE GERMANJA

velut vinculum gestat, donec se caede hostis absolvat. plu- 4
rimis Chattorum hic placet habituS,›iamque canent insignes
et hostibus simul suisque monstrati. omnium penes hos initia
pugnarum3 haec prima semper acieS, visu nova: nam ne in

nulli domus aut5

ager aut aliqua cura: prout ad quemque venere, aluntur,
prodigi alieni, contemptores sui, donec exsanguis senectus
tarn durae virtuti impares faciat.

32. Proximi Chattis certum iam alveo Rhenum, quique

terminus esse sufficiat, Usipi ac Tencteri colunt.

1. absolverit bl.

debtor wore it in token of servitude),
and denoted that the wearer was under
a bond or vow (cp. ‘vinculum' and
‘ absolvat’) to some god (probably
Tin). Aristotle notes (Pol. 7. 2, 6) the
Macedonian institution of wearing a
halter till they had slain an enemy.

id, i. e. ‘anulum gestare': it was
a disgrace generally, except as part of
such a vow.

1. plurimis, ‘to very many ⁷ (c. 17,
4, &c.): ‘placet' is emphatic, and
⁴ habitus ’ (c. 17, 3, &c.) is used of both
the long unkempt hair and the ring.
There are many who even take pride
m it, and instead of laying it aside
when they have slain an enemy, wear
it all their life long. SS. notes the
resemblance to the ‘Berserker' of the
north, popularly known to us through
Kingsley, Hereward, ch. 12, foll.

2. iamque canent = ‘sunt qui iam

caneant,’ ‘there are greyheaded men
thus conspicuous.'
· 3. monstrati, ‘marked for distinc-
tion ²: cp. ‘monstratus fatis Vespasianus'
(Agr. 13, 14), ‘ vetusto nomine . . . mon·
stratus’ (H. 1. 88, 1).

penes hos, ‘ rest with them ’ (cp. e.
6, 4) ; ‘ haec,' ‘ composed of these.'

4. nova z ‘ insolita' (cp. c. 43, 6) :
Freinsh. would read ‘torva,' explained
by ‘ nam,' which may otherwise be ex·
planatory of ‘ semper ’ ε they are always
available.

5. cultu; so most recent edd. (others
‘vultn') z ‘ even in peace they do
not soften themselves by a less fierce
exterior,’ or mode of life (cp. c. 43, 1 3
46, Ι).

5. vultu B b, cultu C c.

6. rura B1 b¹. 7. exangues b.

6. aliqua eura, ‘occupation of any
sort’ (‘ cura alicuius rei ').

7. prodigi, &c., imitated from the
‘ alieni adpetens sui profusus’ of Sall.
Cat. 5. 4: cp. the contrast in H. 1.
492 5·

exsanguis senectus, an expression
taken from Lucan, 1. 343.

8. tam durae virtuti, ‘ such severe
heroism.’

9. certum iam alveo, ⁶ having now
a definite channeL' The words are an
evident reminiscence of Mela (3. 2, 24),

who after speaking of the descent of -

the Rhine from the Alps and its pas-
sage through Lake Constance, adds
‘ mox diu solidus et certo alveo lapsus'
This, and the words that here follow
seem to show that the contrast intended
by Tacitus was not to the divided
Rhine of the Batavian district, but to
the upper Rhine, which was not a
frontier at all but was replaced by the
‘limes' (c. 29, 3-45, though he speaks
as if unaware that the stream in all
that part of its course was not so in—
considerable as to have been incapable
of forming a natural boundary.

10. Usipi, the Usipii of Mart. 6.60, 3,
Usipetes (with Celtic termination> of
A. 1. 51‚4, & Caes. 4. 1, 1. In the
time of Caesar they lived low down
the Rhine between the Yssel and Lippe,
afterwards between the latter and the
Ruhr. A portion at least appear still
later to have taken up a position near
Mainz, and are found with the Chatti
and Mattiaci (H. 4. 37, 4), with the
latter of whom they appear to have
become subject to Rome in Domitian's
