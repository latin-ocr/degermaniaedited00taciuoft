6. ea all, eo Rhen.

Ι. Anglii, ‘dwellers in a corner or
strip,’ the Ἀ’γγειλοί of Ptol. 2, ΙΙ, 15,
who places them on the middle Elbe.
Their real position was probably in
Schleswig, whence they invaded Britain
in the fifth century.

Varini, perhaps wrongly given by
Pliny (4. 14, 27, 99) as a division of the
⁷Vandili. They are generally placed
also in Schleswig; though some think
the name traceable in that of VVarne-
miinde in Mecklenburg.

Eudoses, taken to have lived in Jut-
land; intermediate forms being trace-
able which would connect their name
with that of the Jutes.

suardones, thought by Mf. to have
lived round Lauenberg.

Nuithones. Nothing can be made
of this name or of the various readings.
Some have thought that the real name
was that of the otherwise ignored Teu-
tons (see note on c. 37, Ι), who appear
to have lived in this locality. The
Saxons, first mentioned by Ptol„ after-
wards take the place of several of these
peoples.

2. fluminibus . . . muniuntur. He
has evidently no definite knowledge of
their position.

3. nisi quod. We should have ex-
pected ‘in commune (c. 38, Ι) autem?
All the seven are united by this prob-
ably Ingaevonic worship.

Nerthum; so most edd: ‘ Herthum'
and ‘Hertham ' have been conjectured,
and Holzmann thinks the reading in S.
points to a strange compound form
⁶ mammun Ertham ’ ( ε ‘terram ma-
ἵππι’), corrupted by others into ‘in
commune Nerthum ' by misreading an
abbreviation. Earth is conceived as
the primaeval parent in c. 2, 3. and the
name here (of doubtful meaning) has
been thought to bc a female form of

that of the Northern god Nio'rdhr‚ or
possibly another name of brigg (the
earth viewed as wife of Wuodan in his
capacity of heaven-god, Introd. p. 27,
note 7), or of Freya, daughter of Nio'rdh13
one or other of these goddesses being
the German Aphrodite (cp. ‘ F riday’=
‘dies Veneris'). The male god chiefly
worshipped as a deity of fertility was
Freyr or F ro, son ofNi'ordhr, and thought
to be the chief god of the Ingaevones
(c. 2, 3), to whom this goddess also was
probably a special object of reverence.

tification is merely that of Roman anti-

chariot procession and the ablution of
the chariot and of the symbol of the
goddess, as described below, have also
a remarkable resemblance to the wor-
ship of the ⁶ magna mater ' (Marquardt,
Staatsv. iii. 373), in whom another form
of earth goddess may be recognized
(see c. 45, 3), as also another in Isis
(c. 9, 2). See Introd. p. 28.

4. intervenire, so constructed with
dat. in H. 4. 85, 4, as is also ‘invehi ⁹
in Liv. 44. 2, 2, and ‘invectus’ in Liv.
1, 59, ro. Evidence of processions of
this kind in honour of Freyr is given
by Grimm, and similar customs are
traced in Gaul. The festival was prob-
ably in spring.

5. insula, formerly thought to be
Rugen, but now taken to be Alsen, off
the east coast of Schleswig; the name
of which, as well as those of a forest
and lake in it, contain roots signifying
‘ holiness.'

eastum, probably not only ‘ un-
touched by the axe ’ (cp, Ov. Am. 3, Ι, 1 ;
Luc. 3, 389) but generally free from
human contact.

6. dicatum, dedicated and kept there.
