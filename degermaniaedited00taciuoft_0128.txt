1. Hermundurorum. The latter
part of the name denotes boldness, the
former part may have an intensive force
or may imply descent from Irmin. Their
frontier towards Rome was not (at
least in later times) the river, but the
Raetian part of the ‘limes' <see on
c. 29, 4), and their territory appears
mainly to coincide with parts of Fran—
eonia and north-eastern Bavaria, ex-
tending further to the middle Elbe.

They are known to Vell. (2. 106, 2),

and Strab. (7. Ι, 3, 290) as on the Elbe
or beyond it, but were settled in what
had been the Marcomanic territory by
Domitius about EC. 2 (Dio, 55.10, a, 2),
whence their friendship for Rome: see
also A. 2, 63, 6312. 29, 2; 13. 57, 1. The
name is not known after the Marco-
manic war, but they may be represented
by the later Thuringians.

2. non in ripa, not merely on the
Danube bank, in contrast to ‘ penitus‚'
‘far within the frontier.'

3. in splendidissima . . . colonia.
It is plain that Augusta Vindelicorum
(Augsburg) is meant, a town founded
by Augustus, but not otherwise known
as a colony, and called ‘municipium'
in an inscription (Marqtl. Staatsv. i. 289,
who thinks Tacitus may only mean to
call it a Roman town). Its wealth and
importance are attested by sculptures,
inscriptions, &c. (Friedl. iii. 167).

4: passim sine custode, ‘ every·
where (instead of at stated points only)
and without a guard set over them.'
This privilege may be understood from
the complaint of the Tencteri to the
Agrippinenses (KH. 4. 64, 2) that they
had to deal ‘inermes ac prope nudi,
sub custode et pretio,⁷ disarmed, almost
stripped, under snrveillance, and under

payment of custom dues. See Momms.
Staatsr. iii. 600.

cum, ‘ whereas ': cp. c. 36, 3.

6. non concupiscentibus. The
word seems too strong to mean only
‘not desiring to see them,' and would
rather mean ‘ not hankering after them '
in the way of plunder, as Germans gene-
rally would.

Albis. This name appears to be
German, from a root similar to that in
‘Albunea,' &c., signifying ‘the white
(or bright‘, stream.’ It rises in Bohe-
mia, which is certainly not within the
territory of the Hermunduri (see c. 42, 1).
The most probable supposition is that
a branch, as the Thuringian Saale‚ has
been here confounded with the Elbe
itself.

7. notum, known by exploration.
Tacitus refers to the expedition of Dru—
sus in B. C. 9, and that of Tiberius in
A. D. 4, 5 (see on e. 1, 13 34, 1), and to
the crossing of the upper Elbe by L.
Domitius (see A. 4. 44, 3). It had been
the plan of Augustus to make it the
frontier, but this was frustrated by the
destruction of Varus.

auditur, ‘known by hearsay': cp.
‘ arma . . . audita ’ (c. 37, 2). Tacitus
speaks regreffully, but he certainly was
not in favour of a forward policy in
Germany (see Introd. p. 6).

8. Naristi, so Halm and Pramm.,
with support from Dio, 71. 21 ; others
follow Mf. in reading ‘ Varisti,' which
he supports from Ptol. 2. 11, 23 and as
having an etymological meaning (⁶ most
warlike '). They are taken to have been
a braneh of the Marcomani left in the
Baireuth district of Bavaria and the
Fichtelgebirge.

Marcomani, so (with ίεἶ’) in Stat.
