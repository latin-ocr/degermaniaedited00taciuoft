to a rent in kind1. Other slaves, reduced to servitude by their own
reckless gambling, are described as not kept, but sold ab1·oad2.
Freedmen also constitute a distinct class, of whom he only tells us
that, while insignificant elsewhere, and little above the slave, they
became extremely influential under kings 3. It must be assumed that
they at least resembled the bondsman in exclusion from the franchise,
and had no independent status apart from their lord or patron.
Another intermediate claSS, of whom Tacitus tells us nothing, would
be the ‘ingenui' who had no land, and had to work as free labourers
for hire, or in some other way to accept a position of clientship4.

It is much to be regretted that we are not told more of the local
and tribal government which was even at that date established in
the Germanic race. It was no doubt the case that government of
any kind in Germany had to struggle against a far stronger sentiment
of individual independence than in Gaul: it is clear, however, that the
scattered homesteads, described as built by each as and where he
would, are in‘ some sense ‘vici’ or parts of such ⁵. Probably the
military organization preceded the civilss, the families or clans mar-
shalled together in the host⁷ received their allotments of land together 3,
or a ‘Dorf' of dependants grew up round the ‘Hos’ of a leader9.
Any identity in blood between the members of villages would naturally
be shortlived, and the tie would become political only, as in its
counterpart, the English ‘township¹⁰.’ The most important feature
in the German ‘vicus' at this date is that the free village community
was possessor of the land ¹¹, apportioning it in some way among
occupiers, and that it had a court ‘¹² or council of its own, which must
have been competent to settle disputes on these or other local matters.

¹ It is suggested (Bp. Stubbs, p. 24'
that those in this condition may often
have been the former free occupiers,
dispossessed by a conquering tribe, and
having no -tribal rights.

srecmen might be reduced to slavery, see

⁴ See Bp. stubbs, p. 85. We have
mention of large bodies of ‘clientes'
such as those of Segestes (A. 1. 57, 4), or
those of Inguiomerus, forming an im-
portant addition to an army (A. 2. 45,
22 . Though not properly ‘ comites,’ or
‘gesiths‚' they would form the lower
ranks of the ‘comitatus’ (see below,
1). 26). Cp. the similar train of a Gallie
knight Caes. 6. 15, 2).

⁸ So Caesar says 26. 22, 2), ‘magis-
tratus ac principes in annos singulos
gentibus cognationibusque hominum,
qui una coierint, quantum, et quo loco
visum est, agri adtribuunt? SS. gives
a later instance, and notes the use of
‘fara’ both of a elan and a village.

generally coincides with the later parish,
osten with the manor.
