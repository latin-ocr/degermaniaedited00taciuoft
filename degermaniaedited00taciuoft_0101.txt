1. impares (sc. ‘ ingenuis') libertini,
equivalent to an abstract noun with
genit. as subject to the verb (·' the inferior
position of freedmen is‚' &c.). The con-
struction is more common with partici-
ples (see Draeger, Synt. und Stil, ξ 210).

2. libertatis, political freedom. Thus
the sense of freedom in the Britons made
them disdain Nero's freedman Polycli-
tus when sent to them (A. 14. 39, 3).

3. Faenus agitare, &c. ‘ Agitare‚'
with the sense of ‘exercere' (‘ to make
a business οἷ’), is so used with ⁶ faenus '
in A. 6. 16, 3, and with ‘frumenta,' ‘ vecti—
galia,’ &c. in A. 4. 6, Ι. For ‘ extendere
in,’ cp. c. 17, 3. The difficulty lies in the
second clause, which some take in a dis-
tinct sense, and translate ‘ lending money
on interest and increasing it by compound
interest' (C. R). But the first clause
would make the second very needless‚
and it is perhaps better to take thern
(like so many expressions in this treatise)
as virtually synonymous (‘ to trade with
capital and makeit run on into interest ’).
The evils of Roman practice and a crisis
arising from it are described in A. 6.
16—17. The whole remark is somewhat
unnecessary, in speaking of a nation
who had mostly no money, and dealt
by barter (c. 5, 4).

ideoque, &c. Ζ. (after Kraffert) alters
this to ‘ idque,' explained as ‘ faenus non
agitare'; the idea of which has other·
wise to be supplied from the sense as
subject of ‘servatur.’ The construction
in either case is awkward, and the sen·
tence seems a weak repetition of what
has been already better said at the end
ofc. 19. Thierseh reads ‘ ignominiosum '
for ‘ ignotum‚’ others bracket the whole,
‘faenus . . . esset,' or the latter part,
‘ideoque . . . esset,' as an interpolation.

5. ab universis vicis, ‘by villages
as communities! This reading, pre-
served in one MS. and probably indi-

G2

cated by the corruption ‘ vices ' (for
which ‘in vices ' and ‘ invicem' may be
corrections), is adopted by Z.‚ also by
waitz and other writers, and gives the
best sense to the passage, which appears
to describe a free village (as contrasted
with that noted in c. 25, 1). The form
of such a village community found later
in Germany is that called the mark sys-
tem, on which see Von Maurer, in Sir
H. Maine,Village Communities, pp. 78-
82. The community as such was pos-
sessed of a tract of land, divided into
three marks or portions; (Ι) the mark
of the township or village, the ground
occupied by the dwellings and home-
steads ofits members; (2) the common
land or pasture mark, held by all in
mixed ownership under supervision;
(3) the arable mark, taken out of the
common for cultivation, divided into
three great fields‚ of which one lay fal-
low every year. A portion of this mark
was allotted to and cultivated by every
family, subject to fixed rules of cropping
and fallowing. We cannot, indeed, re-
cognize this system as a whole in the
description here given (see following
notes), but we have perhaps an account
of some state of things out of which it
may have grown. Those who bracket
‘vices’ (as Halm), or read ‘in vices’
or ‘ invicem ' (with a reference to ‘ arva
. . . mutant’ below) would still make
the land to be occupied ‘ab universis‚'
i. e. by communities of men, such as
probably clans or great families see
Introd. pp. 22, 32). For various other
readings, see Mr.

6. secundum dignationem, ‘in pro-
portion to their rank ' (cp. c. 13, 2, and
note): apparently implying that the
‘princeps ' or ‘nobilis' had more than
the simple freeman. Caesar says (6. 22,
2-4) that they had no private land, and
that, as regards common rights,all stood
