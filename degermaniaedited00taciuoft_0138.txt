under a name given by Germans and
denoting ‘ settlers.'

continuantur, middle, ‘ join on to.'

1. quod femina dominatur. This
is thought by Mf. to have been a fable
founded on the fact that these Finns
distinguished themselves from the high-
land Lapps as ‘kainulaiset' (a Finnish
word for ‘Lowlander'), in which was
thought to lie a root of the Gothic
‘ quino’ or -‘quens,' English ‘ qnean '
(γυνή), whence arose legends of a
‘evena land ⁷ or ‘terra feminarum ² in
the north, like the tales of Scythie
Amazons.

in tanturn, ‘to such an extent.'

2. a servitute degenerant, ‘fall
below even slavery' (of the ordinary
t 6).

ΥΞ. Hic Suebiae finis: cp. c. 38, 1.
Some would transpose these words, as
well as the preceding, to the end of c.
44, but they seem required here to point
the contrast to the names which follow.

Peucinorum. These took their
name from an island belonging to the
delta ofthe Danube. They are identified
by Tacitus with the Bastarnae (see
below), but are more properly a division
of them.

Venedorum. Some retain ‘Vene-
torum,’ thinking that Tacitus may have
confused the name with that of the
Gallie (Caes. 3. 8, 1) or Adriatic (Polyb.
2. 17, 5) Veneti. The right name is
clearly ‘ veneciae: or ‘ Venedi ' (Plin. 4.
13, 27, 97; Ptol. 3. 5, 19), answering
to the ‘ Winidae' of lornandes. Ptol.
also gives their name to some moun-
tains and a gulf not easy to identify.
In later times ‘YVend' is a German
designation (thought to mean ‘men of
the pastures.' nomads) for the Slavic
tribes generally, and is no more pro-
perly a national name than ‘ Ἆέῐ1511111611,7
so that we have probably here a people

of that race known to Romans only
through German information‚ and then
probably living from the east of the
Vistula to the sources of the Bory-
sthenes, in and round Poland.

4. Fennorum. These are mentioned
by no earlier writer, and are the Φίννοι
of Ptol. 3. 5, 20, the Finns of the main—
land north of the Aestii, extending from
the Baltic to the Ural mountains. The
name again is German, not national
(derived by Zeuss from the Gothic
‘fani,’ ‘fen,’ by Mf. from ‘finna'=
‘pinna,’ in reference to their use of
snowshoes). It is thought that these
Fenni correspond more in description
to the Lapps (see notes below) ; the true
Finns being the Sitones of c. 45, 9.

Sarmatis, not here used with the
special sense of c 1, Ι, but of all the
Scythian hordes from the Black Sea
northwards. The Sarmatians of this
tract must have been at least in great
part Slavonian (see Introd. p. 15, note 6).

5. quamquam, qualifying the doubt
as regards the first named.

Bastarnas, a widespread name ·
with many subdivisions (Strab. 7. 3, 15,
305 foll.) extending from the sources of
the Vistula to the mouth of the Danube,
and forming one of Pliny's five generic
names (see on c. 2, 3). They are gener-
ally reckoned as true Germans, and as
the first of the race mentioned in
history, having been invited by Philip
of Macedon to aid him against the
Romans in B.C. 179 (Liv. 40. 57).

sermone. Their language was
somewhat known to Romans3 of that
of the Venedi and F enni Tacitus knows
and says nothing.

6. cultu: cp. c. 31, 43 43, 1.

sede ao domiciliis, ‘ mode of settle-
ment and building houses’: i.e. in
having fixed dwellings (see ξ 2) z ‘agunt'
as in c. 29, 3.
