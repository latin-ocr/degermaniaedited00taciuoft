32 INTRODUCTION

so-called matriarchal system is not untraceable ¹, but the state of
society as a whole has far outgrown them. The mixed idea given
us of the host in battle, with its picked national troops, its ‘cuneus'
of free families‚ its groups of ‘comites' attendant on the ‘principes ²‚'
suggests again a possibility that one form of this organization may
have been prominent with some and another with others 3. Most
of all may this be true of their village life and land system. The
possession of lands by village communities in some form is far too
widespread and manifold to be a characteristic of any people 4, and
often seems to adapt itself to some preexistent institutions, or to
survive in some ways or reassert itself where it has been more or less
departed from, or otherwise to take different forms. It is at least
clear in Germany that we have the village as a subdivision of the
‘pagus,' and that it regulated in some way the occupation of the land
comprised in it ⁵. The chief description that we have might in most
points approach to a description of a free village -under the ‘Mark’
system ⁶. ν Yet it would be bold to say that permanent individual
possession of land finds no place in the statement ⁷, or that there
might not have been cases in which the whole village was a cluster
of dependents on a common lordss, or that other intermediate forms
of tenure may not have been in existence. Great movements‚ such
as those which launched the Teutonic tribes against the decaying
Roman empne, would lead naturally to great changes in these
matters ⁵⁸, and it is more remarkable that so much of the account
given in this treatise should be recognizable than that so much should
have passed away.

The armed assembly of the free people which Tacitus describes so
graphically may still be seen in some cantons of Switzerlandw, and

the land (see above, p. 22), the mar-
riage ceremonies (c. 18, 1), the punish-
ment of adultery [c. 19, 2), succession
(c. 20, 5), blood seud (c. 21, ἶ).

³ The organization of the Chatti is
noticed as different in some respects
from other Germans (c. 30, 2). See

the Roman wars on German tactics

⁷ The homesteads round the houses
at least must have been such, and their
‘spatia' may have been considerable.
Also the meaning of ‘partiuntur' is
doubtful (see note).

s See note on c. 25, 1, where it is

‘shown that some think this the pre-

valent type of German village.

⁹ The conquest of territory would
enable a king or prince to reward his
‘comites' by gifts of land subject to
such obligations as would amount to a
beginning of feudalism.
