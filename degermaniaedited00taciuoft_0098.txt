is noted in c. 4, 3 ; and their propensity
to drunkenness was taken advantage of
in war (A. 1. 50, 63 H. 4, 79, 3).

c. gr, 2. .

k 3.‘Ge11)us, διο, ‘they have but one
(in contrast to the variety at Rome) and
in all gatherings the same public game.'
This is the chief ancient account of what
(by disuse of the ‘framea’) was after-
wards known as the sword dance, kept
up till nearly recent times. The games
on horseback called ‘ tiost ' (the ‘joust,’
the origin of the tournament) seem not
to have then existed.

4. nudi; in later times a shirt or
tunic was worn, and the word may be
taken here as thus qualified, or as in
e. 6, 2.

quibus, &c., ‘who make profession
of that exhibition ' (cp. A. 1. 52, 4, Sec..)
It seems not to have been practised
by all, and was probably confined to
freemen.

5. infestas, ‘held menacingly ' (cp.
‘infestis pilis,' H. 1. 31, 7), or perhaps
planted in the ground, point upwards:
‘saltu iaciunt’ is stronger than ‘sal-

view to profit' (cp. ‘in terrorem,’ c. 38,

citatio.' Gifts were later, perhaps al-
ways, given, but it was not a trade,
like that of Roman jugglers, or prac-
tised for wages (‘ mercedem ²), like the
gladiator's calling.

quamvis, δία, ·’ for recklessness, how—
ever daring.' It was, no doubt, in origin,
a religious act, probably in honour
of Tiu (Mars), and joined with the
feasts: cp. ‘noctem sollemnibus epulis
ludicram' (A. 1. 50, 4).

7. aleam‚ &c At Rome dicing was
forbidden by law (see Hor. Od. 3. 24,
58), and, though no doubt common
enough, was tolerated only in hours of
revelry, or 'at such times as the Satur-
nalia. In later times it was prohibited
also among the Germans.

8. inter seria, ‘as one of their earnest
occupationss

9. temeritate, ‘recklessness't we
should naturally expect ‘ludendi‚' for
which words expressing the result are
substituted.

extremo ac novissim0,‘ the deci-
sive and last throw.’ The ideas are
virtually the same; for similar instances,
see Introd. p. 10.

10. corpore, ‘ his pe1·son.' A similar
custom is recorded of the Huns, and
SS‘2. alludes to a poem in the Rig-vedas
and other tales evidencing a prevalence
of gambling among the ancient Indians.

1 1. iuvenior. This rare comparative
form is found in Columella, Pliny mi.,
and Appuleius
