Grimm shows that later German mytho-

such imagery.

Aurora borealis are alluded to, and
that some saw in the description a re-

evidently did not share. The sun god
and his chariot are no doubt to him
mythical.

illue usque, &c., ‘up to that point,
and by true report thus far only, extends
the world': ‘illuc’ is' repeated with
‘ tantum.' and ‘ est ' or ‘ pertinet' would
be supplied. Some prefer to take ‘et
fama vera' as a parenthesis. Halm
and Mr. follow those who somewhat
violently alter ‘et' to ‘si.' ‘Natura'
is shortened sor ‘rerum natura’; so in
Agr. 33, 6 Caledonia is called ‘ terrarum
et naturae finis.'

4. lingua Britannicae propior.
This is no doubt the vague information,
probably of amber traders, who knew
that the language was not German,
and thought it sounded to the ear like
British. Tacitus had mentioned Gallie
speaking people in Germany (c. 43, 1),
and was aware of the resemblance of
British to Gallie (Agr. 11, 4), but
speaks here as if there was some
recognized difference. The language

’ of this people must, however, have had

more resemblance to German than to
any form of Celtic.

matrem deum. This worship, intro-
duced in Β. C. 207 from Phrygia, was
distinet to aRoman from that of‘Terra
mater' (c. 40, 2), but it is by no means
clear that Tacitus means here to dis-
tinguish them, still less that they are
actually distinct (see note there, and
Introd. p. 28). The attempts to find
a Prusso-Lithuanian goddess to corre-
spond seem to be visionary, nor do the
authorities whom Tacitus follows appear
to rest their identification on more than
the wearing of figures of the boar by
the votaries; such figures being worn
as amulets by the priests and wor-
shippers of the ‘magna mater' in Rome.
The boar was otherwise a German
symbol (see on c. 7, 3), and regarded
as typical of courage.
